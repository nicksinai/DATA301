    "1. Select and use statistical modeling and data analytical methods and techniques appropriate to the scale of the problem.\n",
    "2. Operate with diverse types of data (for example, weblog, spatio‚Äêtemporal, basket, transaction, and master)\n",
    "3. Apply data science methods (acquire, integrate, analyze, visualize) to at least one application domain (e.g., Biology, Business, Science, Geostatistics)\n",
    "4. Use the knowledge of Computer Science to design, build and evaluate software\n",
    "5. Use the knowledge of Statistics to analyze data\n",
    "6. Build, maintain, and query common database structures\n",
    "7. Clearly and effectively communicate analysis findings appropriately using oral, written and visual modes."

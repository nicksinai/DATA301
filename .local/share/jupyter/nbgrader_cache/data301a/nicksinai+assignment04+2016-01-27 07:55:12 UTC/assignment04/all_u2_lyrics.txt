It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here
The boys and girls collide
To the music in my ear.

I hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home.

A painted face
And I know we haven't long
We thought that we had the answers
It was the questions we had wrong.

I hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home.

Say so, say so
Say so, say so.
I waited patiently for the Lord.
He inclined and heard my cry.
He brought me up out of the pit
Out of the miry clay.

I will sing, sing a new song.
I will sing, sing a new song.
How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long, how long, how long
How long to sing this song?

You set my feet upon a rock
And made my footsteps firm.
Many will see, many will see and hear.

I will sing, sing a new song.
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song.
I will sing, sing a new song
How long to sing this song? 
How long to sing this song? 
How long to sing this song? 
How long to sing this song? .
No lyrics on this track. 
I gotta go!
I believe in a celebration
I believe we can be free.
I believe you can loose these chains
I believe you can dance with me, dance with me.
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!

I believe in the Third World War
I believe in the atomic bomb.
I believe in the powers-that-be
But they won't overpower me.

And you can go there too,
And you can go, go, go, go!
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake!

And we don't have the time
And everything goes round and round
And we don't have the time
To watch the world go tumbling down.

I believe in the bells of Christchurch
Ringing for this land.
I believe in the cells of Mountjoy
There's an honest man.

And you can go there too, etc.

I believe in the walls of Jericho
I believe they're coming down.
I believe in this city's children
I believe the trumpet's sound.

And you can go there too, etc.
Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
I'm dreaming, you're awake
If I was sleeping, what's at stake?

A day without me.

Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?

A day without me.

Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then let go
In the world I left behind
Shed a tear and let love go.

Little sister don't you worry about a thing today
Take the heat from the sun
Little sister
I know that everything is not ok
But you're like honey on my tongue

True love never can be rent
But only true love can keep beauty innocent

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
No I could never take a chance
Cos I could never understand 
The mysterious distance 
Between a man and a woman

You can run from love
And if it's really love it will find you
Catch you by the heel
But you can't be numb for love
The only pain is to feel nothing at all
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

And you're the one, there's no-one else
You make me want to lose myself
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

Brown eyed girl across the street
On rue Saint Divine
I thought this is the one for me
But she was already mine
You were already mineâ

Little sister
I've been sleeping in the street again
Like a stray dog
Little sister
I've been trying to feel complete again
But you're gone and so is God

The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
When the soul wants, the soul waitsâ

No I could never take a chance
On losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

For love and sex and faith and fear
And all the things that keep us here
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman

How can I hurt when I'm holding you?
From where I stand
I can see through you
From where you're sitting, pretty one
I know it got to you

I see the stars in your eyes
You want the truth, but you need the lies
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino
You give your life for rock n' roll
A-ha

Stand
We're on a landslide of love
You got everything you want
But what you need 
You give away

For primitive love
And a ride on the mystery train
A primitive love
A room at the heart
The heartbreak hotel
A room at the heartbreak
Heartbreak hotel
A room at the heartbreak
Heartbreak hotel

You say it's love, it's not the money
You let them suck your life out like honey
Turning tricks, you're on the street
Selling your kisses so bittersweet

I wanna know
Did you bet again ?
I gotta know
Oh the price
Is to hard to pay

A primitive love
A and a ride on the mystery train
A primitive love
A room at the heart
The heartbreak hotel

A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel

A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak,
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance.

And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, 'desire' time
And your earth moves beneath your own dream landscape.

On borderland we run.
I'll be there, I'll be there tonight
A high-road, a high-road out from here.

The city walls are all come down
The dust a smoke screen all around 
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance.

And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill as the valleys explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of it's own.

O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I
O com-away, o com-away, o-com, o com-away, I say I

Oh, oh on borderland we run
And still we run, we run and don't look back
I'll be there, I'll be there
Tonight, tonight

I'll be there tonight, I believe
I'll be there so high
I'll be there tonight, tonight.

Oh com-away, I say, o com-away, I say.

The wind will crack in winter time
This bomb-blast lightning waltz.
No spoken words, just a scream
Tonight we'll build a bridge across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again tonight.

And your heart beats so slow
Through the rain and fallen snow
Across the fields of mourning to a light that's in the distance.
Oh, don't sorrow, no don't weep
For tonight at last I am coming home.
I am coming home.

Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see
If you just close your eyes you can feel the enemy.
When I first met you girl, you had fire in your soul.
What happened t'your face of melting snow
Now it looks like this!
And you can swallow or you can spit
You can throw it up, or choke on it
And you can dream, so dream out loud
You know that your time is coming round
So don't let the bastards grind you down.

No, nothing makes sense, nothing seems to fit.
I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit.
And I'd join the movement 
If there was one I could believe in
Yeah, I'd break bread and wine 
If there was a church I could receive in.
'Cause I need it now.
To take the cup
To fill it up, to drink it slow.
I can't let you go.

And I must be an acrobat
To talk like this and act like that.
And you can dream, so dream out loud
And don't let the bastards grind you down.

What are we going to do now it's all been said?
No new ideas in the house, and every book's been read.

And I must be an acrobat
To talk like this and act like that.
And you can dream, so dream out loud
And you can find your own way out.
And you can build, and I can will
And you can call, I can't wait until
You can stash and you can seize
In dreams begin responsibilities
And I can love, and I can love
And I know that the tide is turning 'round
So don't let the bastards grind you down.
Dies irae, dies illa
Dies irae, dies illa
Tuba mirum spagrens sonum
Descendit in inferno

Dies irae
Dies irae


(English Translation)

That day of wrath, that day
That day of wrath, that day
The trumpets wonderous calls, sounding abroad
He descends into Hell

That day of wrath
That day of wrath 
I was born a child of grace
Nothing else about the place
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face
And it left me no illusion

I saw you in the curve of the moon
In the shadow cast across my room
You heard me in my tune
When I just heard confusion

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am, I am 

I like the sound of my own voice
I didn't give anyone else a choice 
An intellectual tortoise    
Racing with your bullet train

Some people get squashed crossing the tracks
Some people got high rises on their backs
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks
You can make me perfect again

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am, I am 

I'm alive
I'm being born
I just arrived, I'm at the door
Of the place I started out from 
And I want back inside

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am
I was born a child of grace
Nothing else about the place
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face
And it left me no illusion

I saw you in the curve of the moon
In the shadow cast across my room
You heard me in my tune
When I just heard confusion

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am, I am

I like the sound of my own voice
I didn't give anyone else a choice
An intellectual tortoise
Racing with your bullet train

Some people get squashed crossing the tracks
Some people got high rises on their backs
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks
You can make me perfect again

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am, I am

I'm alive
I'm being born
I just arrived, I'm at the door
Of the place I started out from
And I want back inside

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am
You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want your story to remain untold.
All the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you.

You say you'll give me a highway with no-one on it
Treasure, just to look upon it
All the riches in the night.

You say you'll give me eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest.
All the promises we make, from the cradle to the grave
When all I need is you.

You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night.

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold.
All the promises we break, from the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you.
Here today, gone tomorrow
Crack the bone, get to the marrow
To be a bee and the flower
Before the sweetness turns to sour

What we have we're gonna keep, always
What we've lost we don't need, always
What is it that won't let you sleep, always

Be the arrow and the target
Put your head over the parapet
Be uncool, be awkward
Don't look in the obvious place
The soul needs beauty for a soulmate

Get down off your holy cloud, always
God will not deal with the proud, always
Well if you dream then dream out loud, always
Eternally yours, always

I want you
I want you
I want you

Know what to do yourself, always
Go find yourself in someone else, always
And always wear a safety belt, always
Wait for me I'm running late, always
This is the moment that we share for always
Turning slowly into a prayer, always

Now and forever
For always, 
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far
and Grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me.
His word my hope secures.
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been here ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
America I've given you all and now I'm nothing. 
America two dollars and twenty-seven cents January 17, 1956. 
I can't stand my own mind. 
America when will we end the human war? 
Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb 
I don't feel good don't bother me. 
I won't write my poem till I'm in my right mind. 
America when will you be angelic? 
When will you take off your clothes? 
When will you look at yourself through the grave? 
When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites? 
America why are your libraries full of tears? 
America when will you send your eggs to India? 
I'm sick of your insane demands. 
When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks? 
America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world. 
Your machinery is too much for me. 
You made me want to be a saint. 
There must be some other way to settle this argument. 
Burroughs is in Tangiers I don't think he'll come back it's sinister. 
Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke? 
I'm trying to come to the point. 
I refuse to give up my obsession. 
America stop pushing I know what I'm doing. 
America the plum blossoms are falling. 
I haven't read the newspapers for months, everyday somebody goes on trial for 
murder.
Say goodnight
She waits for me to turn out the light
Really still
She waits to break my will.

Woah-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you.
She cat.
And in the daylight
A blackbird makes a violent sight
And when she is done
She sleeps beside the one

Woah-oh-oh
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.

Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.

It was a cold and wet December day
When we touched the ground at J.F.K.
The snow was melting on the ground
On B.L.S. I heard the sound
(Of an angel).
New York like a Christmas tree
Tonight, this city belongs to me,
(Angel).

Soul love
Well this love won't let me go.
So long
Angel of Harlem.

Birdland on Fifty-Three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles and she's got to be an angel.
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies
(Angel).

Soul love
Well this love won't let me go.
So long
Angel of Harlem.

Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
Empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee-sting.

Blinded, you lost your way
In the side streets and the alleyways
Like a star exploding in the night
Filling up the city with broad daylight.

Angel in devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Angel of Harlem.
Wake up, the dawn of another dull day.
Take up your dreams and on your way.
Oh, oh, oh.

Daylight, mother stands in the hall.
Last night, head against the wall.
Oh, oh, oh.

When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day.

Stop, shout.
They come my way.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Boy, salute in a street uniform
Toy, soldier ripped and torn
Oh, oh, oh.

When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day.

Stop, shout.
They come my way.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Bright morning lights
Wipe the sleep
From another day's eye.
Turn away from the wall
And there's nothing at all.
Being naked and afraid
In the open space of my bed.

I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie.

Just as I am
I awoke with a tear on my tongue
I awoke with a feeling of never before
In my sleep, I discovered the one
But she left with the morning sun.

I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie.

Another time, another place
We lie.
Another time, another place.
We lie.
Another time, another place
We lie.
Your time, your place.

Catching your bright blue eyes in the freeze frame
I've seen them so many times
I feel like I must be your best friend.
You're looking fine, so fine
Dressed up like a lovely day.

Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace.
Babyface, Babyface
Cover girl with natural grace.
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?

Comin' home late at night to turn you on
Checkin' out every frame,
I've got slow motion on my side.
Turnin' around and around
With the sound and colour under my control
Round and around, goin' down,
Dressed up like a lovely day.

Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, Babyface
Tinfoil hair all tied up in lace
Babyface, Babyface
Bitter-sweet girl, won't you give me a taste
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy? 

Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace.
Babyface, Babyface
Open that door, let me unpack my case.
Babyface, Babyface
You're everywhere, child, you're all over the place.
Babyface, Babyface
You're comin' to me from outer space.
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy? 
If you twist and turn away. If you tear yourself in two again. If I could, yes I would If I could, I would let it go. Surrender, dislocate. If I could throw this lifeless life-line to the wind. Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away Into the night, and through the rain Into the half light and through the flame. If I could, through myself, set your spirit free I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away Into the light and to the day. To let it go and so to find away. To let it go and so find away. I'm wide awake. I'm wide awake, wide awake. I'm not sleeping. If you should ask, then maybe They'd tell you what I would say True colours fly in blue and black Blue silken sky and burning flag. Colours crash, collide in blood-shot eyes. If I could, you know I would If I could, I would let it go. This desperation, dislocation Separation, condemnation Revelation, in temptation Isolation, desolation Let it go and so to find away To let it go and so to find away To let it go and so to find away I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake, wide awake I'm not sleeping Oh no, no, no.

Instrumental 
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace


It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
And you feel like it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away


You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you


It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away


Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case


See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
A beautiful day
Don't let it get away


Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know IÃ­m not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
You don't need it now, you don't need it now
Beautiful day
As long as the night is coloured
Blue and black
Oh yeah yeah yeah
As long as you're on your knees
And she's not on her back
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Avenue Atlantico
Seventeen-o-two
She's cocoa butter
Baby, she's the glue

She's got the baby at her breast
She knows big girls are best

Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma
Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma

I'm gonna change like the weather
Hot to cold
Oh yeah yeah yeah
She keeps it all together
She's got the motherload
Oh yeah yeah yeah

She feels it 
Every sensation
She's got a smile
Like salvation
She's got a baby at her breast
She knows big girls are best

Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma
Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma

She's elliptical
Also political
All so spiritual
Not superficial
Yeah, she's tropical
Yes, she's illogical
Those little girls are a pest
Big girls are the best

Oh Oh Oh
Baby

As long as the night is coloured
Blue and black
Oh yeah yeah yeah
As long as you're on your knees
And she's not on her back
Oh yeah yeah yeah

She can taste every sensation
She's got a smile
Like salvation
A baby at her breast
She walk like she talk
Big girls are best

Big Girls

Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma
Oh mama ma
Sexy mama ma

Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy-girl

Finding out
I'm finding out the things
That I've been talking about
I'm finding all the things
That I've been missing out
Finding all the things
I lose my mind
Sometimes fall behind

You and I we live on the big ship
And time goes by
You make up and I believe a lady's lie
The skinheads call it strawberries and cream
Sometimes I scream

Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy-girl

We go out
A picture or a disco or a roundabout
I walk you home, I hold you there
You're giving out
I open doors so I can shut your face
Know your place

Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy-girl

You can take me in your hand
Stand back, leave me, come in
Up and down and all around
You will sideways to the ground

Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl 
16th of June, nine 0 five, door bell rings
Man at the door says if I want to stay alive a bit longer
There's a few things I need you to know. Three

Coming from a long line of travelling sales people on my mother's side
I wasn't gonna buy just anyone's cockatoo
So why would I invite a complete stranger into my home
Would you?

These days are better than that
These days are better than that

Every day I die again, and again I'm reborn
Every day I have to find the courage
To walk out into the street
With arms out
Got a love you can't defeat
Neither down or out
There's nothing you have that I need
I can breathe
Breathe now

16th of June, Chinese stocks are going up
And I'm coming down with some new Asian virus
Ju Ju man, Ju Ju man
Doc says you're fine, or dying
Please
Nine 0 nine, St John Divine, on the line, my pulse is fine
But I'm running down the road like loose electricity
While the band in my head plays a striptease

The roar that lies on the other side of silence
The forest fire that is fear so deny it

Walk out into the street
Sing your heart out
The people we meet
Will not be drowned out
There's nothing you have that I need
I can breathe
Breathe now
Yeah, yeah

We are people borne of sound
The songs are in our eyes
Gonna wear them like a crown

Walk out, into the sunburst street
Sing your heart out, sing my heart out
I've found grace inside a sound
I found grace, it's all that I found
And I can breathe
Breathe now
18th of July on the banks of a not well known river
I started a journey to where I am now
Troubled soul, troublemaker guided by the drums of my creator
Toward a rhythm and rhyme, a melody line of a song called freedom
Which once heard will never leave your head

We are people born of sound
The songs are in our eyes
Gonna wear them like a crown

Walk out into the street
Sing your heart out
This love it can't be beat
We're neither down nor out
There's nothing you have that I need
While I can breathe
Breathe, while I can breathe

All those who stood together fist in air now know this
That real division is not a scar on the land
but in the heart of every man 
who began as a kiss
Not to resist, a knotted fist
Now an open hand, open face, an open page
Where history might rewrite its rage

And the life you get to live is the one you give away
To forget who to forgive is a good thing….

Walk out into the street
Sing your heart out
This love will not be beat
Neither down nor out
There's nothing you have that I need 
while I can breathe
Breathe, while I can breathe

Walk out into the street
Sing your heart out
This love will not be beat
Neither down nor out
There's nothing you have that I need 
while I can breathe
Breathe, while I can breathe

Rolihlahla, Rolihlahla, Rolihlahla, Rolihlahla
In the howlin' wind
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain.

From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below.

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue.

In the locust wind 
Comes a rattle and hum.
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome.

You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire.
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher.

Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue.

Suit and tie comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
(Slappin' 'em down)
One hundred, two hundred.

And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the tin huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street.
Up the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan.
Outside, is America
Outside, is America
America.

See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howlin' the women and children
Who run into the arms
Of America. 
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara
Barbara, Santa Barbara

California, then we fell into the shining sea 
The weight that drags your heart down
Well that’s what took me where I need to be 
Which is here
Out on Zuma 
Watching you cry like a baby
California, at the dawn you thought would never come 
But it did 
Like it always does

All I know 
And all I need to know is there is no end to love

I didn’t call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone’s a star in our town 
It’s just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom
In a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California, blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
I’ve seen for myself
There’s no end to grief 
That’s how I know

That’s how I know 
And why I need to know that there is no end to love
All I know and all I need to know is there is no end to love

(Guitar solo)

All I know 
And all I need to know is there is no end to love
We come and go
Stolen days you don’t give back
Stolen days are just enough
Yesterday I spent asleep
Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap
Spent the night trying to make a deadline
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline

I have your face here in an old Polaroid
Tidying the children's clothes and toys
You're smiling back at me, I took the photo from the fridge
Can't remember what then we did

I haven't been with a woman, it feels like for years
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose
The scent of it lingers and then it just goes

Return the call to home

The worst of us are a long drawn out confession
The best of us are geniuses of compression
You say you're not going to leave the truth alone
I?m here cos I don't want to go home

Child drinking dirty water from the river bank
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank
I'm waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon

Return the call to home

Now I've got a head like a lit cigarette
Unholy clouds reflecting in a minaret
You're so high above me, higher than everyone
Where are you in the Cedars of Lebanon?

Choose your enemies carefully cos they will define you
Make them interesting cos in some ways they will mind you
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends
Gonna last with you longer than your friend
For Guggi

I was running down the road
The fear was all I knew
I was looking for a soul that’s real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship once it’s won
It’s won... it’s one

Northside just across the river to the Southside
That’s a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road

Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
‘Cause it’s never dead it’s still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
I’m still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can’t see
You can... you can

Northside just across the river from the Southside
That’s a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road

If the door is open it isn’t theft
You can’t return to where you’ve never left
Blossoms falling from a tree they cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place we can call home
Cedarwood Road

A HEART THAT IS BROKEN
IS A HEART THAT IS OPEN
The more you see the less you know
The less you find out as you go
I knew much more then than I do now

Neon heart dayglo eyes 
A city lit by fireflies
They're advertising in the skies
For people like us

And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground.

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Oh you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

Don't look before you laugh
Look ugly in a photograph
Flash bulbs purple irises
The camera can't see

I've seen you walk unafraid
I've seen you in the clothes you made
Can you see the beauty inside of me?
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me

And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Oh you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

Time
From the brightest star
Comes the blackest hole
You had so much to offer
Why did you offer your soul?
I was there for you baby
When you needed my help
Would you deny for others
What you demand for yourself?

Cool down mama, cool off
Cool down mama, cool off

You speak of signs and wonders
I need something other
I would believe if I was able
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table

You were pretty as a picture
It was all there to see
Then your face caught up with your psychology
With a mouth full of teeth
You ate all your friends
And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends

You speak of signs and wonders
But I need something other
I would believe if I was able
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table

Where you live should not decide
Whether you live or whether you die
Three to a bed
Sister Ann, she said
Dignity passes by

And you speak of signs and wonders
But I need something other
I would believe if I was able
I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table
You're a precious stone, you're out on your own.
You know everyone in the world, but you feel alone.
Daddy won't let you weep, Daddy won't let you ache
Daddy gives you as much as you can take.
Aha, sha-la. Aha sha-la.
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car.

A little uptight, you're a baby's fist
Butterfly kisses up an' down your wrist.
When you see Daddy comin', you're lickin' your lips
Nails bitten down to the quick.

Aha, sha-la. Aha sha-la.
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car.
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car.

You've got a head full of traffic, you're a siren's song.
You cry for Mama, and Daddy's right along.
He gives you the keys to a flamin' car.
Daddy's with you wherever you are.

Daddy's a comfort, Daddy's your best friend
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end.

Aha, sha-la. Aha sha-la.
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car.
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car.

Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday's alright. 
She is benediction
She is addicted to he
She is the root connection and
She is connecting with me

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
It makes me come up like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He who is chosen by she

Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot
Headed for a spin
Some strange strange music drags me in
It makes me come up like some heroine

She is recreation She intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she

Here I go when I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly 'Til I lose my sense of gravity

I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music drives me on
Makes me come up like some heroine

Oh God I feel for you
Oh God I feel for you
Oh God I feel for you
Oh God I feel for you 
Angel, everything is gonna be alright
Angel, everything is gonna work out tonight

Thirty years old
Sweet as a rose
Every petal of her wafer thin

Love will make you blind
Creep up from behind
Get you jumping out of your skin
Angel, it's sink or swim

Deep in the heart 
Deep in the heart of this place
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place

Door is closed behind me now
The window is sealed to shut out the light
Green as the leaves
And the cure of the nettle sting
Do your homework, It'll work out right

Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place

The scent of cedar
I can still see her
You can't return to the place you never left

Angel, we'll make it work out tonight
Angel, I wanna be home tonight

Door is closed behind me now
The window is sealed, to shut out the light
Green as the leaves the cure of the nettle sting
Do your work and you'll work out right

Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
Deep in the heart
Deep in the heart of this place
Lover, I'm off the streets
I'm gonna go where the bright lights
And the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire
Desire.

She's the candle burnin' in my room
Yeah, I'm like the needle
The needle and spoon
Over the counter, with a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody's got one
I'm in a fever, when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire.

And the fever, gettin' higher
Desire
Desire.
(Burning, burning).

She's the dollars
She's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise
In the year of election.
Sister I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealin' hearts at a travellin' show
For love or money, money, money... ?
And the fever, gettin' higher.
Desire.
I don't know you, you don't know the half of it.
I had a starring role. I was the bad guy who walked out.
They say be careful where you aim 
Because where you aim you might just hit.
You can hold onto something so tight 
You've already lost it.
Dragging me down, that's not the way it used to be.
You can't even remember what I'm trying to forget.

It was a dirty day, dirty day.
Looking for explanations I don't even understand.
If you need someone to blame, throw a rock in the air, you'll hit someone guilty.

From father to son, in one life has begun
A work that's never done, father to son.

(Love, it won't last kissin' time).
(Love, it won't last kissin' time).
(Love, it won't last kissin' time).

Get it right, there's no blood thicker than ink.
Hear what I say, nothing's as simple as you think.
Wake up, some things you can't get around
I'm in you, more so when they put me in the ground.

The days, days, days run away like horses over the hill.
You can reach, but you can't grab it.
You can't hold it, control it
You can't bag it.

You can push, but you can't direct it
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You cannot connect it - love.

You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is but you still want some.
You just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff

You get confused, but you know it
Yeah, you hurt for it, work for it, love
You don't always show it - love.

Let go, let's go, discotheque.
Go, go, let go, discotheque.

Looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead.
You want to be the song
The song that you hear in your head
Love, love, love, love.

It's not a trick, you can't learn it
It's the way that you don't pay that's okay
'Cause you can't earn it - love

You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is
But you still want some
You just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff

Let go, let's go, discotheque.
Go, go, go, go, discotheque.

Looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead.
You want to be the song
The song that you hear in your head
Love, love, love.

But you take what you can get
'Cause it's all that you can find.
Oh you know there's something more
But tonight, tonight, tonight.
Boom cha, boom cha, discotheque.
Take these hands, they're good for nothing
You know these hands never worked a day
Take these boots they're going nowhere
You know these boots don't want to stray.

You got my head filled with songs
You got my shoelaces undone.
Take my shirt, go on, take it off me
You can tear it up if you can tie me down.

Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?

Take the colours of my imagination
Take the scent hanging in the air
Take this tangle of a conversation
Turn it into your own prayer.
With my fingers as you want them
With my nails under your hide
With my teeth at your back
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies.

Do you feel loved? 
Do you feel loved?
And it looks like the sun
But it feels like the rain, oh.

Love's a bully, pushing and shoving
In the belly of a woman.
Heavy rhythm taking over
To stick together a man and a woman
Stick together man and a woman
Stick together. 

Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?

And it looks like the sun
But it feels like rain
And there's heat in the sun
To see us through the rain.

Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Do you feel loved?
Take my hand
You know I'll be there
If you can 
I'll cross the sky for your love.
For I have promised
For to be with you tonight
And for the time that will come.

Take my hand
You know I'll be there
If you can 
I'll cross the sky for your love.
And I understand
These winds and tides
This change of times
Won't drag you away.

Hold on, and hold on tightly.
Hold on, and don't let go of my love.
The storms will pass, it won't be long now.
This love will last, this love will last forever.

And take my hand, you know I'll be there.
If you can I'll cross the sky for your love.
Give you what I hold dear.

Hold on, hold on tightly.
Hold on, and hold on tightly.
Rise up, rise up with wings like eagles.
You run, you run.
You run and not grow weary.

Hold on, and hold on tightly. 
Hold on, hold on tightly 
This love, lasts forever.
Now this love lasts forever. 
The sea it swells like a sore head and the night it is aching
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed
And the day it is breaking

On rainy days we'd go swimming out
On rainy days swimming in the sound
On rainy days we'd go swimming out

You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
If the sky can crack there must be someway back 
For love and only love

Electrical Storm
Electrical Storm
Baby don't cry

Car alarm won't let you back to sleep
You're kept awake dreaming someone elses dream
Coffee is cold but it'll get you through
Compromise that's nothing new to you.
Let's see colours that have never been seen
Let's go places no one else has been

You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
Well if the sky can crack there must be someway back
To love and only love

Electrical storm x 3
Baby don't cry

It's hot as hell, honey in this room
Sure hope the weather will break soon
The air is heavy, heavy as a truck
We need the rain to wash away our bad luck

Well if the sky can crack there must be some way back
To love and only love

Electrical storm x 3

Baby don't cry x 3
High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here,
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse, you elevate my soul

I've lost all self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

A star lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation

A mole, living in a hole
Digging up my soul
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you

A mole, living in a hole
Digging up my soul
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation... 
(Black flash)
Black flash over my own love
Tell me of my eyes
Black flash come though my own life
Telling these things
And I believe them
And I believe in you

White flash sees the sky
And it turns its side from you
She won't turn my back
And I know you turn so blue
And you know
And your sky is feeling blue
And your heart
So cold when I'm with you
And you feel
Like no one told you to
And your time is your side
And your time with me
Ah, don't talk to me
Ah, don't talk to me
Don't talk to me

You know
Like no one told you how
But you know
Though the king that howls has howled
But you feel like sentimental
But you don't care 
If I just share it in your heart
(heart...)

Hopelessly
So hopelessly
I'm breaking through for you and me
And you don't
Though no one told you to
And you found out
Where you were going, where to
You're through with me
But I know that you will be back 
For more

You know
And though no one told you so
And you know, blue sky
Like a harder shade of blue
And you walk
When you want
To let go
Me, I'm the outside, tell me fade away
Drop me down but don't break me
In your sleep

In your sleep, inside
It's in your heart and mine
Whole sea is dark
It's in your heart and mine

Sweetly, those will come
Loving is on your side walking through
So let me in your heart
Your beat is like something...

They...
Run...
See say you're sad and reach by
So say you're sad above beside
Oh stay you're sad over midnight
So stay sad above we said

You know I don't
No one told you how
(and you don't)
(and you wipe sweat off your white brow)
And you care
And no one told you tried
And your heart
Is left out from the side

And the rain beats down
And the shame goes down
And this rain keeps on coming down
And this sky
Tonight...

You know "S" "O" "N" "G", why
You're going go join to God
You know "S" "O" "N" "G", why
Give away some him no lie
Give away some my de day no

You know
And though no one told you sky
And you feel
Like you pretend you can
You say go, you live
Go live outside of me
Don't you leave
Don't leave out part of me
Then can feel
Like I feel before
Like I hurt now
And I see the floor
If you pick me up
Bits and pieces on this floor
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here? 
Give me one more chance, and you'll be satisfied.
Give me two more chances, you won't be denied.
Well my heart is where it's always been
My head is somewhere in between
Give me one more chance, let me be your lover tonight.

(Check it out)
You're the real thing
Yeah the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing.

Give me one last chance, and I'm gonna make you sing
Give me half a chance to ride on the waves that you bring
You're honey child to a swarm of bees
Gonna blow right through ya like a breeze
Give me one last dance, we'll slide down the surface of things

You're the real thing
Yeah the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing.

We're free to fly the crimson sky
The sun won't melt our wings tonight.
Oh now, oh yeah, here she comes
Take me higher, take me higher
You take me higher, you take me higher.

You're the real thing
Yeah, you're the real thing.
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing.
Even better than the real thing.
Even better than the real thing.
Give me one more chance, and you'll be satisfied.
Give me two more chances, you won't be denied.
Well my heart is where it's always been
My head is somewhere in between
Give me one more chance, let me be your lover tonight.

Hearts gone astray
Keeping up when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
You won't regret
I'll come back begging you
Don't you forget
Welcome love we once knew
Yeah

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love

Need you by my side
Come and be my pride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love

From the very start
Open up your heart
Feel the love you've got
Everlasting love

This love will last forever
This love will last forever

Hearts gone astray
Keeping up when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
You won't regret it
I'll come back begging you
Don't you forget
Welcome love we once knew
Yeah

When life really flows
No one really knows
The sun will have to show them
Everlasting love

Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine
Eternal love

Whenever love went wrong
Ours would still be strong
We'd have our own
Everlasting love

This love will last forever
This love will last forever

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love

Need you by my side
Come and be my pride
Never be denied
Everlasting love

From the very start
Open up your heart
Feel the love you've got

Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love 
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there’ll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you’re really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn’t leave it alone
Alone

If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
Knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave

Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul, knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain’s voice
It’s hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
Knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave? 

The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
Knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave
You know he got the cure
But then he went astray
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away.
He wanted to believe
In the hands of love.

His head it felt heavy
As he came across the land
A dog started cryin'
Like a broken-hearted man
At the howling wind
At the howling wind.

He went deeper into black
Deeper into white.
He could see the stars shine
Like nails in the night.

He felt the healing
Healing, healing, healing hands of love
Like the stars shiny, shiny from above.

A hand in the pocket
Fingering the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
And his heart he could feel was beating
Beating, beating, beating,
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love.

So hands that build
Can also pull down
The hands of love.
Every chip from every cup
Every promise given up
Every reason that’s not enough
Is falling, falling at your feet…

Every band elastic limit
Every race when there’s nothing in it
Every winner that has lost their ticket
Is falling, falling at your feet…
I’ve come crawling, falling at your feet…

Everyone who needs a friend
Every life that has no end
Every knee not ready to bend
Is falling, falling at your feet
I’ve come crawling, now I’m falling at your feet…

All fall down…
All the manic days
The faces that you pull
All the x-rays not under your control
The graffiti rolling down off of your tongue
And the compromise you make for someone…

Every teenage with acne
Every face that’s spoiled by beauty 
Every adult tamed by duty 
Are all falling at your feet…

Every foot in every face
Every cop stop that finds the grace
Every prisoner in the Maze
Every hand that needs an ace
Is falling, falling at your feet
I’ve come crawling, now I’m falling at your feet…

All fall down…
All the books you never read
Just started
All the meals you rushed
And never tasted…

Every eye closed by a bruise
Every player who just can’t lose
Every pop star hurling abuse
Every drunk back on the booze
All falling at your feet, all falling at your feet…

All fall down…
All the information
All the big ideas
All the radio waves
On electronic seas
How to navigate
How to simply be
Don’t know when to wait
Explain simplicity
In whom shall I trust?
How might I be still?
Teach me to surrender
Not my will, THY will…
My cell is ringing 
No ID 
I need to know who's calling

My garden's overgrown
I go out on my belly crawling
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC
I got the nightly news
To get to know the enemy

All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your face in a locket
Picture in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it

I know these fast cars
Will do me no good

I'm going nowhere
Where I am it is a lot of fun
They're in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb
I watch them channel hop
Check the stocks
I'm in detox
I want the lot of what you've got
If what you've got can make this stop

All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to be right next to you
All I want is your picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
Take a pill to stop it

I know these fast cars
Will do me no good

Don't you worry about your mind
Don't you worry about your mind
Don't you worry about your mind
Don't you worry about your mind

You should worry about the day
That the pain it goes away
You know I miss mine sometimes

There is no fiction
That will truly fit the situation
I'm documenting every detail
Every conversation
I'm not used to talking to somebody in their body
Look, there's somebody in a body, somebody in a body
Six o'clock 
On the autoroute
Burning rubber, burning chrome
Bay of Cadiz and ferry home
Atlantic sea cut glass
African sun at last

Lights... flash past...
Like memories
A speeding head, a speeding heart
I'm being born, a bleeding start
The engines roar, blood curling wail
Head first then foot
Then heart sets sail
Calling, calling the sun is burning black
Calling, calling, it's beating on my back
With a fire
With a fire.

Calling, calling, the moon is running red
Calling, calling, it's pulling me instead
With a fire, fire.

But there's a fire inside
And I'm falling over
There's a fire in me
When I call out
You built a fire, fire
I'm going home.

Calling, calling, the stars are falling down
Calling, calling, they knock me to the ground
With a fire, fire.

But there's a fire inside
And I'm falling over
There's a fire inside
When I call out
There's a fire inside
When I'm falling over
You built a fire, fire
I'm going home.
Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Yeah, the red, white, and blue
When the band plays 'Hail To The Chief'
Yeah, they'll point the cannon at you

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I'm no millionaire's son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one

Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Well, they help themselves, yeah
When the taxman comes to the door
House looks a like a rummage sale

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Yeah, when they send you down to war
Well, when you ask them how much you should give
Yeah, it's always more, more, more

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I'm no fortunate one

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate son
Take it away 
No Lyrics on this track. 
The future needs a big kiss
Winds blows with a twist
Never seen a moon like this
Can you see it too?

Night is falling everywhere
Rockets at the fun fair
Satan loves a bomb scare
But he won't scare you

Hey, sexy boots
Get on your boots, yeah

You free me from the dark dream
Candy floss ice cream
All our kids are screaming
But the ghosts aren't real

Here's where we gotta be
Love and community
Laughter is eternity
If joy is real

You don't know how beautiful 
You don't know how beautiful you are
You don't know, and you don't get it, do you?
You don't know how beautiful you are

That's someone's stuff they're blowing up
We're into growing up
Women of the future 
Hold the big revelations

I got a submarine
You got gasoline
I don't want to talk about wars between nations

Not right now

Hey sexy boots... 
Get on your boots, yeah
Not right now
Bossy boots

You don't know how beautiful 
You don't know how beautiful you are
You don't know, and you don't get it, do you?
You don't know how beautiful you are

Hey sexy boots
I don't want to talk about the wars between the nations
Sexy boots, yeah

Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Meet me in the sound

Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound, now
God, I'm going down
I don't wanna drown now
Meet me in the sound

Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Let me in the sound, sound
Meet me in the sound

Get on your boots
Get on your boots
Get on your boots
Yeah hey hey

I try to sing this song
I, I try to stand up
But I can't find my feet.
I, I try to speak up
But only in you I'm complete.

Gloria
In te domine
Gloria
Exultate
Gloria
Gloria
Oh, Lord, loosen my lips.

I try to sing this song
I, I try to get in
But I can't find the door
The door is open
You're standing there, you let me in.

Gloria
In te domine
Gloria
Exultate
Oh, Lord, if I had anything, anything at all
I'd give it to you.

Gloria
In te domine
Gloria
Gloria
Don't believe the devil
I don't believe his book
But the truth is not the same
Without the lies he made up.
Don't believe in excess
Success is to give
Don't believe in riches
But you should see where I live.
I, I believe in love.

Don't believe in forced entry
Don't believe in rape
But every time she passes by
Wild thoughts escape.
Don't believe in Death Row
Skid row or the gangs.
Don't believe in the Uzi
It just went off in my hands.
I, I believe in love.

Don't believe in cocaine
Got a speedball in my head
I could cut and crack you open
Did you hear what I said?
Don't believe them when they tell me 
There ain't no cure.
The rich stay healthy
The sick stay poor.
I, I believe in love.

Don't believe in Goldman
His type like a curse
Instant karma's gonna get him
If I don't get him first.
Don't believe that Rock 'n' Roll
Can really change the world
As it spins in revolution
Yeah, it spirals and turns.
I, I believe in love.

Don't believe in the sixties
The golden age of pop
You glorify the past
When the future dries up.
Heard a singer on the radio
Late last night
Says he's gonna kick the darkness
Till it bleeds daylight.
I, I believe in love.

Feel like I'm fallin'
I'm spinnin' on a wheel
It always stops beside a name
A presence I can feel.
I believe in love.
Stop!
You get to feel so guilty
Got so much for so little
The you find that feeling just won't go away.
You're holding on to every little thing so tightly
Till there's nothing left for you anyway.

Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down.

You wanted to get somewhere so badly
You had to lose yourself along the way.
You changed your name
Well that's okay, it's necessary
And what you leave behind you don't miss anyway.

Goodbye, you can keep this suit of lights
I'll be up with the sun
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down.

'Cause I'm already gone
Felt that way all along.
Closer to you every day
I didn't want it that much anyway.

You're taking steps that make you feel dizzy
Then you learn to like the way it feels.
You hurt yourself, you hurt your lover
Then you discover
What you thought was freedom is just greed.

Goodbye, and it's an emotional
Goodnight, I'll be up with the sun.
Are you still holding on?
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down
I'm not coming down.

Grace, she takes the blame
She covers the shame
Removes the stain
It could be her name

Grace, it's the name for a girl
It's also a thought that changed the world
And when she walks on the street
You can hear the strings
Grace finds goodness in everything

Grace, she's got the walk
Not on a ramp or on chalk
She's got the time to talk
She travels outside of karma
She travels outside of karma
When she goes to work
You can hear her strings
Grace finds beauty in everything

Grace, she carries a world on her hips
No champagne flute for her lips
No twirls or skips between her fingertips
She carries a pearl in perfect condition

What once was hurt
What once was friction
What left a mark
No longer stings
Because Grace makes beauty
Out of ugly things

Grace makes beauty out of ugly things 
I see you're dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until
Hallelujah here she comes

I see you're dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back
Hallelujah here she comes

Born and raised
On the wrong side of town
You get so high
That you can't come down

Yeah

I see the road is rough
You know I'm not giving up
Hallelujah here she comes

I know where the lady goes
I know she got a ring on her toes
Hallelujah here she comes

Born and raised
On the wrong side of town
You get so high
That you can't come down

I'm going higher, higher, higher
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love 
High on, high on, high on love 
I'm gonna be there
When that light's gonna shine
I'm gonna be there
When her heart is next to mine
I'm gonna be
Here she comes
Yeah here she comes

I see you're dressed to kill
I know I can't wait until
Hallelujah here she comes

I see you're dressed in black
I guess I'm not coming back
Hallelujah here she comes

Born and raised
In the wrong side of town
You get so high
You can't come down

I'm gonna be there
High on, high on, high on love
Gonna get high on, high on, high on love
Gonna get high on, high on, high on love
Gonna get high on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love
High on, high on, high on love

I'm gonna be there
When that light's gonna shine
I'm gonna be there
When her heart is next to mine
I'm gonna be there

be there
When Hallelujah...here she comes
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Here she comes...
Oh Here she comes...

Oh Here she comes...
Here she comes...
High on, high on, high on love

Happiness Is A Warm Gun

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do oh yeah
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do oh yeah

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness Is A Warm Gun
Happiness Is A Warm Gun

She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes wide open while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Happiness is a a warm gun
Happiness is a a warm gun
Happiness is a a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun

Happiness is a warm gun
Happiness is a warm gun

I need a fix cause I'm going down
need a fix cause I'm going down
need a fix cause I'm going down
to the bits that I left uptown

need a fix cause I'm going down

Like a desert needs rain
Like a town needs a name
I need your love.

Like a drifter needs a room
Hawkmoon
I need your love.
I need your love.

Like a rhythm unbroken
Like drums in the night
Like sweet soul music
Like sunlight
I need your love.

Like coming home
And you don't know where you've been
Like black coffee
Like nicotine
I need your love,
I need your love.

When the night has no end
And the day yet to begin
As the room spins around
I need your love
I need your love.

Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree
Like the sweet revenge 
Of a bitter enemy
I need your love.

Like heat needs the sun
Like honey on her tongue
Like the muzzle of a gun
Like oxygen
I need your love,
I need your love.

When the night has no end
And the day yet to begin
As the room spins around
I need your love
I need your love.

Like thunder needs rain
Like a preacher needs pain
Like tongues of flame
Like a sweet stain
Need your love
I need your love.

Like a needle needs a vein
Like someone to blame
Like a thought unchained
Like a runaway train
Need your love, 
I need your love.
Need your love
I need your love.

Like faith needs a doubt
Like a freeway out
Need your love.

Like powder needs a spark
Like lies need the dark
I need your love.
See the sunrise over her skin
Don't change it.
See the sunrise over her skin
Dawn changes everything, everything.
And the delta sun
Burns bright and violent.

Mississippi and the cotton wool heat
Sixty-six - a highway speaks
Of deserts dry
Of cool green valleys
Gold and silver veins
All the shining cities
In this heartland
In this heartland
In this heartland.
Heaven knows
This is a heartland.
Heartland, our heartland.

See the sunrise over her skin
She feels like water in my hand
Freeway, like a river
Cuts through this land
Into the side of love
Like a burning spear
And the poison rain
Like dirty tears
Through the ghostranch hills
Death Valley waters
In the towers of steel
Belief goes on and on
In this heartland
In this heartland
In this heartland
Heaven knows
This is a heartland.
When you get to the bottom
You go back to the top of the slide
And you stop and you turn
And you go for a ride
Then you get to the bottom
Then you see me again

Do you, don't you want me to love you
Coming down fast I'm right here above you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
Ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

Do you, don't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast now don't let me break you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
You ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

When you get to the bottom
You go back to the top of the slide
And you turn and you stop 
And you go for a ride
Then you get to the bottom
Then you see me again

Do you, don't you want me to love you 
Coming down fast I'm right here above you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
Ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter...(and again)

Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter 
You don't know how you took it
You just know what you got
Oh lawdy, you been stealing from the thieves
And you got caught
In the headlights of a stretch car,
You're a star.

Dressing like your sister
Living like a tart
If they don't know what you're doin' 
Babe it must be art,
You're a headache, in a suitcase
You're a star.

Oh, no, don't be shy
You don't have to go blind,
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me.

You don't know how you got here
You just know you want out
Believing in yourself almost as much as you doubt,
You're a big smash
You wear it like a rash
Star.

Oh no, don't be shy
You need a crowd to cry,
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me.

They want you to be Jesus
They'll got down on one knee
But they'll want their money back
If you're alive at thirty-three,
And you're turning tricks
With your crucifix.
You're a star, oh child

Of course you're not shy
You don't have to deny love,
Hold me
Thrill me
Kiss me
Kill me.
I
I am a humble guy
No really I try
You know it's hard sometimes

You 
Yeah you're messed up too
Both of us gonna get through
Working my way to get to you

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, be good to me
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, be good to me
Here it comes 
Here it comes 
Holy Joe

Please
Don't make me say please
With champagne and ice cream
It's not what I want it's what I need

Devotion
Little appreciation
Little heavy rotation
Looks good on me

Totally messed up in everybody's life
Closer than ever to everybody's wife
Yeah...

Come on come on
Come on come on, be good to me
Come on come on
Come on come on, be good to me
Here it comes 
Here it comes 
Holy Joe

Totally mixed up in everybody's life
Closer than ever to everybody's wife
Yeah...

Come on come on
Come on come on, be good to me
Come on come on
Come on come on, be good to me
Here it comes 
Here it comes 
Holy Joe

Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe

Here it comes
Here it comes
Holy Joe
Julie says, John I'm getting nowhere
I wrote this letter, hope to get someplace soon
I want to get up
When I wake up
But when I get up
I fall down.

Julie wake up, Julie tell the story
You wrote the letter, said you were gonna
Get there someday
Gonna walk in the sun
And the wind and the rain
Never look back again
Now you fall down
You're falling down
You fall down
You fall down.

You're falling down
You fall down
You fall down.

Julie say something, Julie say you're sorry
You're gonna get better, you better not
Leave me here anyway
I want to get up, when you wake up
But when I get up
I fall down
I'm falling down
I fall down
I broke myself.

I fall, I fall down
I'm falling down
I fall downÃ–
When you fall 
I fall with you
And when you're falling down
Is when I hit the ground.
I fall with you
I fall down.
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you.

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
(I was) burning inside her.

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one.
But yes, I'm still running.

You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
I was talking, I was talking to myself
Somebody else talk, talk, talking.
I couldn't hear a word, a word he said.

He was my brother
I said there was no other way out of here
Be my brother
(Brother).
Got to get out, got to get out.

I was walking, I was walking into walls
And back again
I just keep walking
I walk up to a window to see myself
And my reflection, when I thought about it
My direction, going nowhere, going nowhere.

No-one, no-one is blinder 
Than he who will not see.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than me.

I was talking, I was talking in my sleep
I can't stop talk, talk, talking
I'm talking to you, it's up to you
Be my brother, there is no other way out of here
Be my brother
Got to get out, got to get out
Got to get out of here.
I was on the outside when you said
You needed me
I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see.

A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by the hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh why?

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
I will follow.

I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found.

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
I will follow.

Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes, your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes.

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow.
I will follow.


She's a rainbow and she loves the peaceful life
Knows I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight
There's a part of me in the chaos that's quiet
And there's a part of you that wants me to riot

Everybody needs to cry or needs to spit
Every sweet tooth needs just a little hit
Every beauty needs to go out with an idiot
How can you stand next to the truth and not see it?

A change of heart comes slow

It's not a hill, it's a mountain
As you start out the climb
Do you believe me, or are you doubting
We're gonna make it all the way to the light
But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight

Every generation gets a chance to change the world
Pity the nation that won't listen to your boys and girls
Cos the sweetest melody is the one we haven't heard
Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear?
The right to appear ridiculous is something I hold dear
Oh, but a change of heart comes slow

It's not a hill, it's a mountain
As you start out the climb
Listen for me, I'll be shouting
We?re gonna make it all the way to the light
But you now I'll go crazy if I don?t go crazy tonight

Baby, baby, baby, I know I?m not alone
Baby, baby, baby, I know I?m not alone

It's not a hill, it's a mountain
As we start out the climb
Listen for me, I'll be shouting
Shouting to the darkness, squeeze out sparks of light

You know we'll go crazy
You know we'll go crazy
You know we'll go crazy if we don't go crazy tonight

Oh oh
Slowly now
Oh oh
NA
Instrumental. 
It's a beautiful day
Everything is goin' my way
Even the words are doing what I say
Oh babe, got to get away.
To be impossible
Isn't that difficult
In the city you're invisible
When you come from a small town.

Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby, please.

Tourist in a traffic jam
Babycham and handicam.
I'm not your mother, you're not my man.
I'm not your baby.
Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick.
Don't need no doctor, I'm not ill.
I'm not your baby.
Everything is alright, etc.

Cut out the poetry
Let's hit the main artery
No time for a tourniquet
Let the colours all run out of me.
You've brought me all kinds of goods
Now my heart is so full up it hurts.
It's heavy as a shopping bag
Full of things I should give back.

Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby, please.

Not dizzy, just busy
Didn't drink nothing fizzy
No pills to feel easy
Don't know what got into me
Daylight a kinda robbery
The night is your geography
You're not white
You're pink and rosy
You could be right 
But you're way above me.

I'm in recovery
A star of pornography.
I'm a tourist
There's a lot to see
You don't like the photographs of me
So, you've got a lot to say
You don't sleep around, but sometimes you stray
You don't believe
But oftentimes you pray for something
What is it babe?

Don't treat me like I'm a trick
I won't treat you like you're a prick.
Don't need no doctor, I'm not sick.
I'm not your baby.
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
I'm not your baby.

Everything is alright

Nobody else here baby
No-one else here to blame
No-one to point the finger
It's just you and me and the rain.

Nobody made you do it
No one put words in your mouth.
Nobody here taking orders
When love took a train heading south.
It's the blind leading the blond
It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs.

Hey, if God will send his angels
And if God will send a sign
And if God will send his angels
Would everything be alright?

God's got his phone off the hook, babe
Would he even pick up if he could?
It's been a while since we saw that child
Hangin' round this neighbourhood.

See his mother dealing in a doorway
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl.
And Jesus' sister's eyes are a blister
The High Street never looked so low.

It's the blind leading the blond
It's the cops collecting for the cons.
So where is the hope and
Where is the faith and the love?
What's that you say to me
Does love light up your Christmas tree?
The next minute you're blowing a fuse
And the cartoon network turns into the news.

If God will send his angels
And if God will send a sign
Well if God will send his angels
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

Jesus never let me down
You know Jesus used to show me the score.
Then they put Jesus in show business
Now it's hard to get in the door.

It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs
But I guess it was something to go on.
Hey, if God will send his angels
I sure could use them here right now
Well, if God will send his angels...

Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Tonight, the moon is playing tricks again
I'm feeling seasick again.
The whole world could just dissolve
Into a glass of water.

I've been good, 'cause I know you don't want me to.
Do you really want me to be blue as you?
It's her daylight that gets me through.

We've been here before
Last time you scratched at my door
The moon was naked and cold
I was like a two-year-old
Who just wanted more.

If you wear that velvet dress.
If you wear that velvet dress.

Tonight, the moon's drawn its curtains
It's a private show
No-one else gonna know
I'm wanting.

Sunlight, sunlight fills my room
It's sharp and it's clear
But nothing at all like the moon.

It's okay
The struggle for things not to say
I never listened to you anyway
And I got my own hands to pray.

But if you wear that velvet dress.
If you wear that velvet dress.

Tonight the moon is a mirror-ball
Light flickers from across the hall
Who'll catch the star when it falls.

If you wear that velvet dress.
In a little while
Surely you'll be mine
In a little while... I'll be there
In a little while
This hurt will hurt no more
I'll be home, love

When the night takes a deep breath
And the daylight has no air
If I crawl, if I come crawling home
Will you be there?

In a little while
I won't be blown by every breeze
Friday night running to Sunday on my knees
That girl, that girl she's mine
Well I've known her since,
Since she was

A little girl with Spanish eyes
When I saw her first in a pram they pushed her by
Oh my, my how you've grown
Well it's been, it's been... a little while

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Slow down my beating heart
A man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies
He lives on a star that's dying in the night
And follows in the trail, the scatter of light
Turn it on, turn it on, you turn me on

Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love 
Desert sky, dream beneath the desert sky.
The rivers run but soon run dry.
We need new dreams tonight.
Desert rose, dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons and bows
Like a siren she calls (to me).

Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country

Set me alight, we'll punch a hole right through the night.
Every day the dreamers die to see what's on the other side.
She is liberty, and she comes to rescue me.
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold.

Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country

Naked flame, she stands with a naked flame
I stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love. 
In the ocean cuts ring deep, the sky.
Like there, I don't know why.
In the forest there's a clearing 
I run there towards the light.
Sky, it's a blue sky.

In the earth the hole deep, deep, decide.
If I could I would.
Up for air to swim against the tide.
Hey, hey, hey. 
Up towards the sky.
It's a blue sky.

To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this the longest day.

So wind go through to my heart.
So wind blow through my soul.
So wind go through to my heart.
So wind blow through my soul.
So wind go through to my heart.

You give yourself to this the longest day.
You give yourself, you give it all away.

Two rivers run too deep, the seasons change and so do I.
The light that strikes the tallest trees the light away for I.
The light away, up towards the sky.
It's a blue sky.

To lose along the way the spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade on this the longest day.

So wind go through to my heart.
So wind blow through my soul.
So wind go through to my heart.
So wind blow through my soul.
So wind go through my heart.
So wind blow through my soul.
So wind go through to my heart.

You give yourself to this the longest day.
You give yourself, you give it all away.

Into the heart of a child
I stay awhile
But I can go there.

Into the heart of a child
I can smile
I can't go there.

Into the heart, into the heart of a child
I can't go back
I can't stay awhile.
Into the heart.

Into the heart.

It’s like the room just cleared of smoke I didn’t even want the heart you broke It’s yours to keep, you just might need one I finally found my real name I won’t be me, when you see me again No I won’t be my father’s son

I’m more than you know
I’m more than you see here
I’m more than you let me be
I’m more than you know
A body and soul
You don’t see me but you will
I am not invisible

I’m leaving the Invisible world
I’m leaving the Invisible world

I don’t dream, not as such
I don’t even think about you that much
Unless I start to think at all
Of those frozen days
And your frozen ways
They melt away
Your face like snow

I’m more than you know
I’m more than you see here
I’m more than you let me be
I’m more than you know
A body and soul
You don’t see me but you will
I am not invisible
I am here

There is no them
There is no them
There’s only us
There’s only us
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only us
There’s only us
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only you
There’s only me
There is no them
The star, 
that gives us light
Has been gone a while
But it’s not an illusion
The ache
In my heart 
Is so much a part of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years

Hold me close, hold me close and don’t let me go.
Hold me close like I’m someone that you might know
Hold me close the darkness just lets us see 
Who we are
I’ve got your light inside of me

Iris... Iris...

Once we are born, we begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
I’m sure I’ve met
Long before the night the stars went out
We’re meeting up again

Hold me close, hold me close and don’t let me go.
Hold me close like I’m someone that you might know
Hold me close, the darkness just lets us see 
Who we are
I’ve got your light inside of me

Iris... Iris...

The stars are bright but do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold

You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream 
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Don’t fear the world it isn’t there

Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand,
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me

Iris... Iris...

Free yourself, to be yourself if only you could see yourself
Free yourself, to be yourself if only you could see...
Oh to sing this song makes me angry
I'm not angry with you.
Is that all?
Is that all?
Is that all?

Oh to sing this song makes me happy
I'm not happy with you.
Oh to sing this song makes me dance.
Is that all?
Is that all?
Is that all?

Is that all?
Is that all?
Is that all?
Is that all you want from me?
Johnny Swallo
Stop watching
I take you by the hand

Stop inside
Paul and me
We walk by

Walking silent
I saw
It was burning

Village
On fire
Was a village on fire 
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie

CHORUS
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

CHORUS

He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

CHORUS

Go
Go

CHORUS

Go
Go, go
Something is about to give
I can feel it coming
I think I know what it is
I'm not afraid to die
I'm not afraid to live
And when I'm flat on my back
I hope to feel like I did

Cause hardness, it sets in
You need some protection
The thinner the skin

I want you to know
That you don't need me anymore
I want you to know
You don't need anyone, anything at all

Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to know what it is will break you
I don't know which way the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
Don't wanna see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye

In summer I can taste the salt in the sea
There's a kite blowing out of control on a breeze
I wonder what's gonna happen to you
You wonder what has happened to me

I'm a man, I'm not a child
A man who sees
The shadow behind your eyes

Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to know what it is will break you
I don't know where the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
I don't wanna see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye

Did I waste it?
Not so much I couldn't taste it
Life should be fragrant
Roof top to the basement
The last of the rock stars
When hip hop drove the big cars
In the time when new media
Was the big idea
That was the big idea
Here she comes
Lady luck again
Figure of eight
Six and Nine again
I, I, I, my lady with the spinning head

Whatever the deal
She won't let me down
Wherever I go
She's always hangin' round

Lady with the spinning head
Lady with the spinning head

She's been gone
But I knew she'd be back
She's got the rent
She put me in the black
I, I need you lady with the spinning head

Mean old man took away my car
Those credit guys they've got the power
I'm on top
When she's around
She's my ticket
Out of town

Lady with the spinning head
Lady with the spinning head
Lady with the spinning head

She feel the ground is giving way
But she thinks we're better off that way.
The more you take, the less you feel
The less you know the more you believe
The more you have, the more it takes today.

You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
Give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

Well she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth.

She's not waiting on a saviour to come
She's at the bus stop
With the News Of The World
And the sun, sun, here it comes.
She's not waiting for anyone.

You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
Give it away.
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

Well she don't care what it's worth
She's living like it's the last night on earth
The last night on earth.

Slipping away, slip, slide
Too many slipping away.
The world turns and we get dizzy
Slipping away.

She's living
She's living next week now.
You know she's gonna pay you back somehow.

She hasn't been to bed in a week
She'll be dead soon, then she'll sleep.

You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away
Give it away
You gotta give it away
You gotta give it away

She already knows it hurts
She's living like it the last night on earth
The last night on earth
Last night on earth
Last night.
Lemon, see-through in the sunlight.
She wore lemon, see-through in the daylight.
She's gonna make you cry, she's gonna make you whisper and moan.
When you're dry she draws water from a stone.
I feel like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slippin' under.
I feel like I'm holding on to nothing.

She wore lemon to colour in the cold grey night.
She had heaven and she held on so tight.

A man makes a picture, a moving picture
through the light projected, he can see himself up close.
A man captures colour, a man likes to stare.
He turns his money into light to look for her.
And I feel like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore.
And I feel like I'm swimming out to her.

Midnight is where the day begins.
Midnight is where the day begins.
Lemon, see-through in the sunlight.

A man builds a city, with banks and cathedrals.
A man melts the sand so he can see the world outside.
A man makes a car, and builds a road to run (them) on.
A man dreams of leaving, but he always stays behind.

You're gonna meet her there
She's your destination
You gotta get to her
She's imagination

And these are the days when our work has come asunder.
And these are the days when we look for something other.

Midnight is where the day begins.
Midnight is where the day begins.
Midnight is where the day begins.
Midnight is where the day begins.

A man makes a picture, a moving picture;
Through light projected, he can see himself up close.
A man captures colour, a man likes to stare.
He turns his money into light to look for her.

Gotta meet her there
She's your destination
There's no sleeping there
She's imagination

She is the dreamer, she's imagination.
Through the light projected, he can see himself up close.
Like a song I have to sing
I sing it for you.
Like the words I have to bring
I bring it for you.

And in leather, lace and chains we stake our claim.
Revolution once again
No I won't, I won't wear it on my sleeve.
I can see through this expression and you know I don't believe.
Too old to be told, exactly who are you?
Tonight, tomorrow's too late.

And we love to wear a badge, a uniform
And we love to fly a flag
But I won't let others live in hell
As we divide against each other
And we fight amongst ourselves
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song
Let the bells ring out
Let the bells ring out
Is there nothing left?
Is there, is there nothing?
Is there nothing left?
Is honesty what you want?

A generation without name, ripped and torn
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain
Nothing at all
And if you can't help yourself
Well take a look around you
When others need your time
You say it's time to go... it's your time.
Angry words won't stop the fight
Two wrongs won't make it right.
A new heart is what I need.
Oh, God make it bleed.
Is there nothing left? 
Lay down
Lay down
Lay your sweet lovely on the ground
Lay your love on the track
We're gonna break the monster's back
Yes we areâ
Lay down your treasure
Lay it down now brother
You don't have time
For a jealous lover

As you enter this life
I pray you depart
With a wrinkled face
And a brand new heart

I don't know if I can take it
I'm not easy on my knees
Here's my heart you can break it

I need some release, release, release

We need 
Love and peace
Love and peace

Lay down
Lay down your guns
All your daughters of Zion
All your Abraham sons

I don't know if I can make it
I'm not easy on my knees
Here's my heart and you can break it
I need some release, release, release

We need
Love and peace
Love and peace

Baby don't fight
We can talk this thing through
It's not a big problem 
It's just me and you
You can call or I'll phone
The TV is still on
But the sound is turned down
And the troops on the ground 
Are about to dig in

And I wonder where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Love and peace
Love don't need to find a way
You find your own way
I forget that I can't stay
And so I say that
All roads lead to where you are
All roads lead to where you are

The seed is spilled, the bed defiled
For you, a virgin bride
I'm yourself in someone else
Don't find yourself in me

I can't lift you up again
Love comes tumbling down again

Love don't need to find a way
You find your own way
I forget that you can stay
And so I say that
All roads lead to where you are
All roads lead to where you are 
Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart, love is blindness.

In a parked car, in a crowded street
You see your love made complete.
Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness.

Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel.
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness.

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love,
Blindness.

A little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense.

Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets, and no one to tell.
Take the money, honey...
Blindness.

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love,
Blindness.
Love rescue me
Come forth and speak to me
Raise me up
And don't let me fall.
No man is my enemy
My own hands imprison me.
Love rescue me.

Many strangers have I met
On the road to my regret
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me.
They ask me to reveal
The very thoughts they would conceal.
Love, rescue me.

And the sun in the sky
Makes a shadow of you and I
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea.
I'm here without a name
In the palace of my shame
I said, love, rescue me.

In the cold mirror of a glass
I see my reflection pass
I see the dark shades of what I used to be.
I see the purple of her eyes
The scarlet of my lies.
Love, rescue me.

Yeah, though I walk
In the valley of the shadow
Yet, I will fear no evil.
I have cursed thy rod and staff
They no longer comfort me.
Love, rescue me.

Sha la la la etc.
I said love, love, rescue me.

Yeah, I'm here without a name
In the palace of my shame
I said love, rescue me.

I've conquered my past
The future is here at last
I stand at the entrance to a new world I can see.
The ruins to the right of me
Will soon have lost sight of me.
Love, rescue me.

Punk rock party in a suburban home
Everybody’s famous here but nobody’s known
We got no music cos the speaker’s blown apart

The spirit’s moving through a seaside town
I’m born again to the latest sound
New wave airwaves swilling around my heart

You no longer got a hold on me,
I’m out of Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me,
You’re no longer in control of me,
I am.

The NME is spitting from an inky page
St John Divine is gonna take the stage
At the talent show where your talent is your rage
I’m in.

Prayers of fire on a raindog night
Young men see visions beyond sound or sight
The Velvets beginning to see the light
Amen.

You no longer got a hold on me,
I’m out of Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me,
You’re no longer in control of me,
I am.

Yes I can change the world
Yes I can change the world

The poor breaking bread that’s made out of stone
The rich man won’t eat, he’s eating, alone
That’s easy
But I can’t change the world
In me.

You no longer got a hold on me,
I’m out of Lucifer’s hands
You no longer got a hold on me,
You’re no longer in control of me,
I am
Hey sister love
Hey sister sun
Hey oh my love
You turn me around tonight
Hey sister love

Save my soul
Save my soul
Hold on to love
Hold on to love
Love won't to let you go
Love won't to let you go
Hold on to love
See the sunshine in her soul

Hey sister love
Hey sister sun

She come likes carnival
She is the big wheel
She turn my head around
Turn my head around
She is the speedway
She is the slipstream
She is coming round

Hold on to love
Hold on to love
Love won't to let you go
Hold on to love
Hold on to love

See the sunlight in her soul
See the sunlight in her soul

She is the gun fire
She is the car crash
She is the avalanche
She is the thunder
She is the waves and
She pulls me under

I love you cause I need to
Not because I need you
I love you cause I understand
That God had given me your hand
Holds me in a tiny fist
And still I need your kiss

Hold on to love
See the sunlight in her soul
See the sunlight in her soul 
Sleep, sleep tonight
And may your dreams be realised.
If the thunder cloud passes rain
So let it rain, rain down on he.
So let it be.
So let it be.

Sleep, sleep tonight
And may your dreams be realised.
If the thunder cloud passes rain
So let it rain, let it rain
Rain down on he. 
Magnificent
Magnificent  

I was born
I was born to be with you
 In this space and time
 After that and ever after I haven't had a clue
 Only to break rhyme
This foolishness can leave a heart black and blue

  Only love, only love can leave such a mark 
But only love, only love can heal such a scar 

I was born
I was born to sing for you 
 I didn't have a choice but to lift you up 
And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice 
From the womb my first cry, it was a joyful noise ...

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
 But only love, only love can heal such a scar 

Justified till we die, you and I will magnify
 The Magnificent
 Magnificent 

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
 But only love, only love unites our hearts  

Justified till we die, you and I will magnify
The Magnificent 
Magnificent
 Magnificent 

Weather 'round here choppin' and changin'
Surgery in the air
Print shirts and southern accents
Cigars and big hair.

We got the wheels, petrol's cheap
We only went there for a week
Got the sun, got the sand
Got the batteries and the handicam.

Her eyes all swimming pool blue
Dumb-bells on the diving board
Baby's always attracted to
The things she's afraid of. 

Big girl with a sweet tooth watches
Skinny girl in the photo shoot.
Freshmen, squeaky-clean she tastes of chlorine.
Miami, my mammy.

Love the movies, babe
Love to walk through movie sets
Get to shoot someone in the foot
Get to smoke some cigarettes.

No big deal, we know the score
Just back from the video store.
Got the car and the car chase. 
What's he got inside that case?
I want a close-up of that face. 
Here comes the car chase.

I bought two new suits
Miami
Pink and blue
Miami
I took a picture of you
My mammy
Getting hot in a photo booth
Miami.

I said you looked like a madonna.
You said maybe.
You said I wanna have your baby, baby.
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
We could make something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
Least not in Miami.

You know, some places are like your auntie
But there's no place like Miami
My mammy
Miami
My mammy.
I want to trip inside your head
Spend the day there
To hear the things you haven't said
And see what you might see

I want to hear you when you call
Do you feel anything at all?
I want to see your thoughts take shape
And walk right out 

Freedom has a scent 
Like the top of a new born baby's head

The songs are in your eyes
I see them when you smile
I've had enough I'm not giving up 
On a miracle drug

Of science and the human heart
There is no limit
There is no failure here sweetheart 
Just when you quit

I am you and you are mine
Love makes nonsense of space 
And time, will disappear 
Love and logic keep us clear
Reason is on our side, love

The songs are in your eyes
I see them when you smile
I've had enough of romantic love
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up
For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug

God I need your help tonight

Beneath the noise 
Below the din
I hear a voice
It's whispering
In science and in medicine 
€œI was a stranger
You took me in

The songs are in your eyes
I see them when you smile
I've had enough of romantic love
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up
For a miracle, miracle drug

Miracle, miracle drug
Is there a time for keeping your distance 
A time to turn your eyes away.
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day.

Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
Is there time for cutting hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear.

Here she comes, heads turn around
Here she comes, to take her crown.

Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell.
A time for different colours
Different names you find hard to spell.

Is there a time for first communion
A time for East 17
Is there time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen.

Here she comes, beauty plays the clown
Here she comes, surreal in her crown.

Dici che il fiume
Trova la via al mare
E come il fiume
Giungerai a me
Oltre i confini
E le terre assetate
Dici che come il fiume
Come il fiume...
L'amore giungerà
L'amore...
E non so più pregare
E nell'amore non so più sperare
E quell'amore non so più aspettare

Is there a time for tying ribbons
A time for Christmas trees.
Is there a time for laying tables
When the night is set to freeze.
Lookin' for to save my, save my soul
Lookin' in the places where no flowers grow.
Lookin' for to fill that God-shaped hole
Mother, mother-suckin' rock an'roll.

Holy dunc, space junk cominÃ­ in for the splash
White dopes on punk staring into the flash.
Lookin' for the baby Jesus under the trash
Mother, mother-suckin' rock an' roll.
Mother. (scat singing)

Mother, am I still your son?
You know I've waited for so long
To hear you say so.

Mother, you left and made me someone.
Now I'm still a child, but no one tells me no.

Lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world.
Lookin' for the father of my two little girls.
Got the swing, got the sway, got my straw in lemonade.
Still lookin' for the face I had before the world was made.
Mother, mother-suckin' rock an' roll

Soothe me, mother
Rule me, father
Move me, brother
Woo me, sister.

Soothe me, mother
Rule me, father
Show me, mother
Show me, mother.

Show me, mother
Show me, mother
Show me, mother
Show me, mother.
I tied myself with wire
To let the horses run free
Playing with the fire
Until the fire played with me

The stone was semi-precious
We were barely conscious
Two souls too cool to be
In the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day

We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
It's not if I believe in love
But if love believes in me
Oh, believe in me

At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I've been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
My body's now a begging bowl
That's begging to get back, begging to get back
To my heart
To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control

I was punching in the numbers at the ATM machine
I could see in the reflection
A face staring back at me
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

I was speeding on the subway
Through the stations of the cross
Every eye looking every other way
Counting down 'til the pentecost

At the moment of surrender
Of vision of over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me

Midnight, our sons and daughters
Were cut down and taken from us.
Hear their heartbeat
We hear their heartbeat.

In the wind we hear their laughter
In the rain we see their tears.
Hear their heartbeat, we hear their heartbeat.

Night hangs like a prisoner
Stretched over black and blue.
Hear their heartbeats
We hear their heartbeats.

In the trees our sons stand naked
Through the walls our daughter cry
See their tears in the rainfall.
Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in, to fill up your room.
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand.

She's slippy, you're sliding down.
She'll be there when you hit the ground.

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways, oh.

Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain.
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal.
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy!

She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child.

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways, yeah, oh, ah.

Lift my days, light up my nights, oh.

One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love.
While you could stand there,
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling.

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
She moves in mysterious ways.

Move you, spirits move you
Move, spirits 'its move you, oh yeah.
Does it move you?
She moves with it.
Lift my days, and light up my nights, oh.
All is quiet on New Year's Day.
A world in white gets underway.
I want to be with you, be with you night and day.
Nothing changes on New Year's Day.
On New Year's Day.

I... will be with you again.
I... will be with you again.

Under a blood-red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, says
Say it's true, it's true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one.

I... I will begin again
I... I will begin again.

Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
Oh, maybe the time is right.
Oh, maybe tonight.
I will be with you again.
I will be with you again.

And so we are told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
In New York freedom looks like too many choices
In New York I found a friend to drown out the other voices
Voices on the cell phone
Voices from home
Voices of the hard sell
Voices down the stairwell
In New York, just got a place in New York

In New York summers get hot, well into the hundreds
You can't walk around the block without a change of clothing
Hot as a hairdryer in your face
Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
In New York, I just got a place in New York
New York, New York

In New York you can forget, forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in
But it's down to Alphaville

New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York

The Irish have been coming here for years
Feel like they own the place
They got the airport, city hall, concrete, asphalt, they even got the police
Irish, Italian, Jews and Hispanics
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew,
Living happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you... NewYork 

New York, New York
New York, New York

In New York I lost it all to you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out my mid life crisis
I hit an iceberg in my life
But you know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice a-whispering
Come away child

New York, New York 
The tomtoms
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tick of the eye of the clock
You're standing up against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops
When the sun shines through
So a voice within me
Keeps revealing you
You

Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Why is it so ?
That this longing for you follows
Wherever I go
In the roaring traffic gloom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
Though such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life 
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me
Oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning, burning inside of me
This torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life 
Making love to you
Day and night
Night and day

Night and day
Night and day
Night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night, night, night and day
Night and day
Night, 
Night and day

All I want to do
Is make love to you
I'll miss you baby sing it 
I know a girl who's like the sea
I watch her changing every day for me
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

One day she's still, the next she swells
You can hear the universe in her sea shells
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

No, no line on the horizon, no line

I know a girl with a hole in her heart
She said infinity is a great place to start
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

She said "Time is irrelevant, it's not linear"
Then she put her tongue in my ear
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line

The songs in your head are now on my mind
You put me on pause
I'm trying to rewind and replay

Every night I have the same dream
I'm hatching some plot, scheming some scheme
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm a traffic cop, rue du Marais
The sirens are wailing but it's me that wants to get away
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

No line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
I want to reach out over the lough
And feel your hand across the water

Walk with you along an unapproved road
Not looking over my shoulder

I want to see, and I want to hear
To understand your fears
But we're north & south of the river

I've been doing it wrong all of my life
This holy town has turned me over
A young man running from what he didn't understand
But the wind from the lough just got colder and colder

There was a badness that had it's way
Love was not lost, love will have it's day
North & south of the river
North & south of the river

Can we stop playing these old tattoos ?
Darling, I don't have the answer
I want to meet you
Where you are
I don't need you to surrender
There's no feeling
Thats so alone
As when the one you're hurting is your own
North & south of the river
North & south of the river
North & south of the river

Some high ground is not worth taking
Some connections are not worth making
There's an old church bell no longer ringing
Some old songs are not worth bringing
North (Some high ground is not worth taking)
North & south of the river 

Don't move
      Don't talk out-a time,
      Don't think
      Don't worry, everything's just fine
      Just fine.

      Don't grab
      Don't clutch
      Don't hope for too much
      Don't breathe

      Don't check, just balance on the fence
      Don't answer
      Don't ask
      Don't try and make sense.

      Don't whisper
      Don't talk
      Don't run if you can walk,
      Don't cheat, compete
      Don't miss the one beat.

      Don't travel by train
      Don't eat
      Don't spill
      Don't piss in the drain
      Don't make a will.

      Don't fill out any forms
      Don't compensate
      Don't cover
      Don't crawl
      Don't come around late
      Don't hover at the gate

      Don't take it on board
      Don't fall on your sword
      Just play another chord
      If you feel you're getting bored

      Don't change your brand
      Don't listen to the band
      Don't gape 
      Don't ape
      Don't change your shape
      Have another grape

      Chance, dance, dismiss, apologise

      Don't spy
      Don't lie
      Don't try
      Imply 
      Detain

October and the trees are stripped bare
Of all they wear.
What do I care?

October and kingdoms rise
And kingdoms fall
But you go on
And on.
Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now you got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life, when it's one need in the night.
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.

Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love and you want me to go without.
Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light.
We're one, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other... one

Have you come here for forgiveness,
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much, more than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got.
We're one, but we're not the same.
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again.

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law.
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt.

One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should.
One life with each other: sisters, brothers.
One life, but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other.
One, one.
I'm around the corner from anything that's real
I'm across the road from hope
I'm under a bridge in a rip tide
That's taken everything I call my own

One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing

I'm on an island at a busy intersection
I can't go forward, I can't turn back
Can't see the future
It's getting away from me
I just watch the tail lights glowing

One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
Knowing, knowing

I'm hanging out to dry 
With my old clothes
Finger still red with the prick of an old rose
Well the heart that hurts 
Is a heart that beats
Can you hear the drummer slowing

One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
To knowing, to knowing, to knowing


With special thanks to Noel Gallagher
We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
As the day begs the night for mercy, love.

A sun so bright it leaves no shadows
Only scars carved into stone on the face of earth.

The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes.

You run like a river on to the sea
You run like a river runs to the sea. 

And in the world, a heart of darkness, a fire-zone 
Where poets speak their heart then bleed for it

Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love.
You know his blood still cries from the ground.

It runs like a river runs to the sea.
It runs like a river to the sea.

I don't believe in painted roses or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful.

I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill.

We run like a river runs to the sea
We run like a river to the sea.

And when it's rainin', rainin' hard
That's when the rain will break a heart.

Rainin', rainin' in your heart
Rainin' in your heart.
Rainin', rain into your heart
Rainin', rainin', rainin'
Rain into your heart.
Rainin', ooh, rain in your heart, yeah.
Feel it.

Oh great ocean
Oh great sea
Run to the ocean
Run to the sea.
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore.
The sunlight warms your skin.
All the beauty that's been lost before, wants to find us again.
I can't fight you anymore; it's you I'm fighting for.
The sea throws rocks together but time, leaves us polished stones.

We can't fall any further if, we can't feel ordinary love.
And we cannot reach any higher, if we can't deal with ordinary love.

Birds fly high in the summer sky and rest on the breeze.
The same wind will take care of you and I, we'll build our house in the trees.
Your heart is on my sleeve, did you put it there with a magic marker.
For years I would believe, that the world, couldn't wash it away

Cause we can't fall any further if, we can't feel ordinary love.
And we cannot reach any higher, if we can't deal with ordinary love.

Are we tough enough, for ordinary love?

We can't fall any further if, we can't feel ordinary love.
And we cannot reach any higher, if we can't deal with ordinary love.

Are we tough enough, for ordinary love?
Are we tough enough, for ordinary love?
Are we tough enough, for ordinary love
Baby slow down
The end is not as fun as the start
Please stay a child somewhere in your heart

I'll give you everything you want
Except the thing that you want
You are the first one of your kind

And you feel like no-one before
You steal right under my door
And I kneel cos I want you some more
I want the lot of what you got 
And I want nothing that you're not

Everywhere you go you shout it
You don't have to be shy about it

Some things you shouldn't get too good at
Like smiling, crying and celebrity
Some people got way too much confidence baby

I'll give you everything you want
Except the thing that you want
You are the first one of your kind

And you feel like no-one before
You steal right under my door
I kneel cos I want you some more
I want the lot of what you got 
And I want nothing that you're not

Everywhere you go you shout it
You don't have to be shy about it, no
And you'll never be alone
Come on now show your soul
You've been keeping your love under control

Everywhere you go you shout it
You don't have to be shy about it

Everywhere you go you shout it
Oh my my

And you feel like no-one before
You steal right under my door
I kneel cos I want you some more
I want you some more, I want you some more
Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long.
Say how long.

It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad.

I had the feeling it was out of control
I was of the opinion it was out of control.

Boys and girls to school
And girls they make children
Not like this one.

I had the feeling it was out of control
I was of the opinion it was out of control.

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control.

I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood

One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate.

I had the feeling it was out of control
I was of the opinion it was out of control.

I see a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day

I look inside my self
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black

No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

I Wanna see it painted
Painted Black
Black as night

I Wanna see it painted
Painted Black
Black as night

I Wanna see it painted
Painted Black
Black as night

I Wanna see it painted
Painted Black
Black as night

I Wanna see it painted
Painted Black
Black as night

I Wanna see it painted
Painted Black
Black as night
I know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
And she won't tell me her name

I know a boy
A boy called Trash, Trash Can
I know he does all that he can, wham bam
And she won't tell me his name

When I was three
I thought the world revolved around me
I was wrong
But you can sing, sing along
And if you dance
Then dance with me

I know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl

I know a boy
A boy called Trampoline
You know what I mean
I think you know what he wants
I think he knows what he wants
I think he knows what he wants.

Heaven on Earth
We need it now
I'm sick of all of this
Hanging around
Sick of sorrow
Sick of pain
Sick of hearing again and again
That there's gonna be
Peace on Earth

Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies
They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you

It's already gone too far
Who said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt

Jesus could you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
No whos or whys
No-one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth
She never got to say goodbye
To see the colour in his eyes
Now he's in the dirt
Peace on Earth

They're reading names out over the radio
All the folks the rest of us won't get to know
Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann and Breda
Their lives are bigger, than any big idea

Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
To tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth

Jesus this song you wrote
The words are sticking in my throat
Peace on Earth
Hear it every Christmas time
But hope and history won't rhyme
So what's it worth?
This peace on Earth

Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth 
People Have the Power by Patti Smith
So you never knew love
Until you crossed the line of grace.
And you never felt wanted
Till you'd someone slap your face.
So you never felt alive
Until you'd almost wasted away.

You had to win, you couldn't just pass
The smartest ass at the top of the class
Your flying colours, your family tree
And all your lessons in history.

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees.
Please, please, please, please, oh yeah.

And you never knew how low you'd stoop
To make that call
And you never knew what was on the ground
Till they made you crawl.
So you never knew that the heaven
You keep you stole.

Your Catholic blues, your convent shoes,
Your stick-on tattoos now they're making the news
Your holy war, your northern star
Your sermon on the mount from the boot of your car.

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees.
Please, please, please
Leave me out of this, please.

So love is hard
And love is tough
But love is not
What you're thinking of.

September, streets capsizing
Spilling over down the drains
Shard of glass, splinters like rain
But you could only feel your own pain.

October, talk getting nowhere.
November, December; remember
We just started again.

Please, please, please
Get up off your knees, yeah.
Please, please, please, please, ah.

So love is big
Is bigger than us.
But love is not
What you're thinking of.
It's what lovers deal
It's what lovers steal
You know I've found it
Hard to receive
'Cause you, my love
I could never believe.
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go.
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

Early morning, April four
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.

In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
In the name of love
What more in the name of love.
Earth, sky, scenery.
Is she coming back again?
Men of straw, snooker hall.
Words that build or destroy
Dirt dry, bone, sand and stone.
Barbed wire fence cut me down.
I'd like to be around in a spiral staircase
To the higher ground.

And I, like a firework, explode.
Roman candle, lightning, lights up the sky.
In cracked streets, trample underfoot.
Side-step, sidewalk.
I see you stare into space.
Have I got closer now, behind the face?

Oh, tell me, Cherry you dance with me
Turn me around tonight
Up through the spiral staircase to the higher ground.
Slide show, seaside town.
Coca-cola, football radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio. 
Face down on a broken street
There’s a man in the corner in a pool of misery.
I’m in a white van as a red sea covers the ground
Metal crash I can’t tell what it is
But I take a look and now I’m sorry I did.
5:30 on a Friday night 33 good people cut down

I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore

Face down on a pillow of shame
There are some girls with a needle tryin to spell my name
My body’s not a canvas
My body’s now a toilet wall. 

I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore

Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes,
You disappear

Boy sees his father crushed under the weight 
Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate.
Blue mink Ford, I’m gonna detonate and you’re dead
Blood in the house,
Blood on the street
The worst things in the world are justified by belief
Registration 1385-WZ

I don’t believe anymore
I don’t believe anymore

Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes,
You disappear
From father to son
The blood runs thin
Ooh, see the faces frozen (still)
Against the wind.

The seam is split
The coal-face cracked
The lines are long
There's no going back.

Through hands of steel
And heart of stone
Our labour day
Has come and gone.

They leave me holdin' on
In Red Hill Town.
See the lights go down on ...

Hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to.
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to.

The glass is cut
The bottle run dry.
Our love runs cold 
In the caverns of the night.

We're wounded by fear
Injured in doubt.
I can lose myself
You I can't live without.

Yeah, you keep me holdin' on 
In Red Hill Town.
See the lights go down on

Hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to.
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
On to.

We scorch the earth
Set fire to the sky
And we stooped so low
To reach so high.

A link is lost
The chain undone.
We wait all day 
For night to come
And it comes like a hunter (child).

I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to.
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to.

We see love, slowly stripped away
Our love has seen its better day.
Hangin' on
Lights go down on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill.
The lights go down on Red Hill.
The lights go down on Red Hill Town..
Oh I talk to you, you walk away.
You're still on the down beat
You say you don't want my help.
But you can't escape if you're running from yourself.
I give you my love
I give you my love
Give you my love
Still you walk away.
Well

It's your own late show as you jump to the street below.
But where can you go to leave yourself behind?
Alone in the spotlight of this, your own tragedy.
I give you my love. 
Love.

I give you my love.
Give you my love.
I give you my love.
I give you my love.
I give you my love.

It's falling, it's falling
And outside a building comes tumbling down.
And inside a child on the ground
Says he'll do it again.

And what am I to do?
What in the world am I to say?
There's nothing else to do.
He says he'll change the world some day
I rejoice.

This morning I fell out of bed
When I woke up to what he had said
Everything's crazy but I'm too lazy to lie.

And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world
But I can change the world in me
Rejoice.
Rejoice.

And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world 
But I can change the world in me. 

I rejoice.

And so she woke up
Woke up from where she was lyin' still.
Said I gotta do something
About where we're goin'.

Step on a fast train
Step out of the driving rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night.
Singing ah, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day.

Sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth.
I see seven towers, but I only see one way out.
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice.
You know I took the poison, from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here, singing
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day.

She walks through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under black belly of cloud in the rain.
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea.

She is ragin'
She is ragin'
And the storm blows up in her eyes.
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still.
Baby please
Baby please don't go
I got lies to feed
They want skin and seed
Now don't make me crawl

Please
Baby don't bite your lip
Give you half what I got
If you untie the knot
It's a promise
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it 
Salome
Shake it shake it shake it 
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it 
Salome

Baby please
Baby what's that tune
Well I heard it before
When I crawled from your door
And my blood turned blue

Please
Baby please slow down
Baby I feel sick
Don't make me stick to my promise
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it
Salome
Shake it shake it shake it 
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it 
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it
Salome

Baby please
Baby don't say no
Won't you dance for me
Under the cherry tree
Won't you swing down low

Please
Baby please say yes
Baby don't go away
You're spilling me
And your precious love
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it 
Salome
Shake it shake it shake it
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it
Salome

Salome
Shake it shake it shake it
Salome
Salome
Shake it shake it shake it 
Salome
Satellite's gone

Things like that drive me
Out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

Satellite of love

Satellite's gone
Way up to Mars
Soon it will be filled
With parking cars
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

With Harry, Mark and John

Takes a second to say goodbye, say goodbye
Takes a second to say goodbye, say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, say bye-bye.
Where you going to now?
Lightning flashes across the sky
East to West, do and die.
Like a thief in the night, see the world by candlelight.
Fall, rise and... 
Fall, rise and...

In an apartment on Times Square
You can assemble them anywhere.
Held to ransom, hell to pay
A revolution every day.
U.S.S.R., G.D.R., London, New York, Peking.
It's the puppets, it's the puppets pull the strings, yeah.
Fall, rise and...
Fall, rise and...

Say goodbye, say goodbye 
Say goodbye, say goodbye.

It takes a second to say goodbye
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh.
Push the button and pull the plug
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh.

Fall, rise and...
Fall, rise and...

And they're doing the atomic bomb
Do they know where the dance comes from?
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb
They want you to sing along.

Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye.

Back to the cold restless streets at night
Talk to myself about tomorrow night.
Walls of white protest
A gravestone in name
Who is it now?
It's always the same.

Who is it now? Who calls me inside?
Are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.

Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.

Life through a window
Discoloured pain
Mrs Brown's washing is always the same
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.

Do you feel in me
Anything redeeming
Any worthwhile feeling?
Is love like a tightrope
Hanging on my ceiling?

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.

Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.

Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.

Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.

In the shithouse a shotgun
Praying hands hold me down.
If only the hunter was hunted
In this tin can town, tin can town.
No stars in the black night
Looks like the sky fall down.
No sun in the daylight
Looks like it's chained to the ground, chained to the ground.

The warden says "The exodus sold."
If you want a way out...
Silver and gold, silver and gold.

Broken back to the ceiling
Broken nose to the floor.
I scream at the silence
It's crawling, crawls under the door.
There's a rope around my neck
And there's a trigger in your gun.
Jesus, say something!
I am someone, I am someone.

Captains and Kings in the ship's hold
They came to collect
Silver and gold, silver and gold.

I seen the coming and the going
Seen the captains and the Kings.
Seen their navy blue uniforms
Seen them bright and shiny things, bright and shiny things.

The temperature is rising
The fever white hot
Mister I ain't got nothing
But it's more than you've got
These chains no longer bind me
Nor the shackles at my feet
Outside are the prisoners
Inside the free (set them free).

A prize fighter in a corner is told
Hit where it hurts - For Silver and Gold
You can stop the world from turning around
You just gotta pay a penny in the pound.
Wake,
In the morning when you wake up,
You won’t have much but you’ll have enough
When you are weakest I’ll be strong enough for you,
Dreams, the ones where you are fearless
Can’t break what’s broken, you are tearless
Steal back your innocence
That’s what they stole from you

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight

Stop, stop.
Where you stand right now, just stop.
Don’t think or look down at the drop
The people staring from the street don’t know what you’ve got

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
No, not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
But you can sleep like a baby tonight

Hope is where the door is
When home is where the war is
Where nobody can feel no one else’s pain

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Not everything can be so black and white
There are demons in the broad daylight
You’ve got to sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Take care of your heart until it is light
Where you stand, where you fall is where I kneel
To take your heart back to where you can feel
Like a child, a child.
Morning, your toast, your tea and sugar,
Read about the politician’s lover
Go through the day like knife through butter 
Why don’t you  
You dress in the colours of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone else’s suicide
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight 

Dreams,
It’s a dirty business, dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where there’s no daylight, there’s no healing

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight

Hope is where the door is 
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one else’s pain

You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird, your dreams take flight
Like St Francis covered in light
You’re gonna sleep like a baby tonight
My love is cruel as the night
She steals the sun and shuts out the light.
All of my colours turn to blue
Win or lose.

Slow dancing, slow dancing, slow (dancing).

Scarlet eyes and see-through heart
I saw her coming right from the start.
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just a-begging her please.

(Take me) slow dancing, slow dancing, slow.

And, I don't know why a man will search for himself
In his woman's eyes.
No, I don't know why a man sees the truth
But believes the lies.

My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience
And I don't want it back
It just gets in the way.

Slow dancing, etc.
We crossed the line, who pushed who over?
It doesn't matter to you, it matters to me.
We're cut adrift, but still floating.
I'm only hanging on to watch you go down, my love.

I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me.
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasn't what you wanted.
The men who love you, you hate the most
They pass right through you like a ghost.
They look for you, but your spirit is in the air.
Baby, you're nowhere.

Oh, love, you say in love there are no rules.
Oh, love, sweet-heart, you're so cruel.

Desperation is a tender trap
It gets you every time.
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie.
Her skin is pale like God's only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug.

Oh, love, you say in love there are no rules.
Oh, love, sweet-heart, you're so cruel.

She wears my love like a see-through dress
Her lips say one thing, her movements something else.
Oh, love, like a screaming flower
Love dying every hour.
Ah, you don't know if it's fear or desire,
Danger the drug that takes you higher?
Head of heaven, fingers in the mire
Her heart is racing you can't keep up.
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust we are trampled underfoot.

Oh, love, to stay with you I'd be a fool.
Oh, sweetheart, you're so cruel.
Some days are dry, some days are leaky
Some days come clean, other days are sneaky.
Some days take less, but most days take more
Some slip through your fingers and on to the floor.
Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy
Some days you use more force than is necessary.
Some days just drop in on us.
Some days are better than others.
Some days it all adds up
And what you've got is enough.
Some days are better than others.

Some days are slippy, other days are sloppy;
Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy.
Your skin is white, but you think you're a brother.
Some days are better than others.
Some days you wake up with her complaining.
Some sunny days you wish it was raining.
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin;
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in.
Some days you hear a voice
Taking you to another place.
Some days are better than others.

Some days are honest, some days are not;
Some days you're thankful for what you've got.
Some days you wake up in the army
And some days it's the enemy.
Some days are work, most days you're lazy;
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby
Lookin' for Jesus and his mother.
Some days are better than others.
Some days you feel ahead;
You're making sense of what she said.
Some days are better than others.

Some days I hear a voice taking me to another place.
Some days are better then others. 
Tough, you think you've got the stuff
You're telling me and anyone
You're hard enough

You don't have to put up a fight
You don't have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight

Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone

And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own

We fight all the time
You and I, that's alright
We're the same soul
I don't need, I don't need to hear you say
That if we weren't so alike
You'd like me a whole lot more

Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone

And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own

I know that we don't talk
I'm sick of it all   
Can - you - hear - me - when - I -
Sing, you're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in meâ

Where are we now?
I've got to let you know
A house still doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone...

And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you that makes it hard to let go 
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
Sometimes you can't make it 
The best you can do is to fake it
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I’ve been
You’ve got eyes that can see right through me
You’re not afraid of anything they’ve seen
I was told that I would feel nothing the first time
I don’t know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

If there is a light you can’t always see
And there is a world we can’t always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn’t doubt
And there is a light, don’t let it go out

And this is a song, song for someone
This is a song, song for someone

You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You break and enter my imagination
Whatever’s in there it’s yours to take
I was told I’d feel nothing the first time
You were slow to heal but this could be the night

If there is a light you can’t always see
And there is a world we can’t always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don’t let it go out

And this is a song, song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

And I’m a long long way from your Hill of Calvary
And I’m a long way from where I was and where I need to be
If there is a light you can’t always see
And there is a world we can’t always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don’t let it go out
Wey, hey, baby hang on
Wey, hey, baby hang on
Hang to your heartbeat, tight as a drum
Hang on to your love, see it shines like a song
Wey. hey, hey, baby hang on
Our love shines like rain
In those spanish eyes

Wey, hey, hey, here she comes
Comes in colours, now she's gonna turn the daylight on
'Cause I love the way you talk to me
And I love the way you walk on me
And I need you more than you need me (yeah)
Our love shines like rain in those spanish eyes

I'll cross the world for green and gold
But, it's those spanish eyes that get me home
Home again 

Wey, hey, hey, sugar hang on
Wey, hey, hey, you know that the night is as young
I'm dazzled by a light that shines in your eyes
I'm used to standing in the shadows and waiting for the night
Forever in fever, forever in heat
You re-invented me, now don't put me back on the street

Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
Wey, hey, hey, baby hang on
'Cause I love the way you talk to me
And I mean the things you mean to me
I need you
Love love love love love...
Love love love love love...

I got to stand up and take a step
You and I have been asleep for hours
I got to stand up 
The wire is stretched in between our two towers
Stand up in this dizzy world
Where a lovesick eye can steal the view
I'm gonna fall down if I can't stand up
For your love

Love love love love love...

Stand up, this is comedy
The DNA lottery may have left you smart
But can you stand up to beauty, dictator of the heart
I can stand up for hope, faith, love
But while I'm getting over certainty
Stop helping God across the road like a little old lady

Out from under your beds  
C'mon ye people
Stand up for your love

Love love love love love...

I gotta stand up to ego but my ego's not really the enemy
It's like a small child crossing an eight lane highway
On a voyage of discovery

Stand up to rock stars, Napolean is in high heels
Josephine, be careful of small men with big ideas

Out from under your beds
C'mon ye people 
Stand up for your love

Love love love love love...

God is love
And love is evolution's very best day

Soul rockin' people moving on
Soul rockin' people on and on
C'mon ye people
We're made of stars
C'mon ye people
Stand up then sit down for your love

Love love love love love...
Love love love love love...
Summer stretching on the grass
Summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree
Creeps a-crawling over me
Over me and over you
Stuck together with God's glue
ItÃ­s gonna get stickier too.
ItÃ­s been a long hot summer
Let's get under cover
Don't try too hard to think
Don't think at all.

I'm not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you take a look inside.
Not just deaf and dumb
IÃ­m staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind.

There's an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won't disappear.
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you wanna see what the scratching brings!
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach.
Will we ever live in peace?
'Cause those that can't do often have to
And those that can't do often have to preach

To the ones staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside.
Not just deaf and dumb, staring at the sun
I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind.

Intransigence in all around
Military's still in town
Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won't say goodbye
Referee won't blow the whistle.
God is good but will he listen?
I'm nearly great but there's something missing.
I left it in the duty free,
Oh, though you never really belonged to me.

You're not the only one staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside.
I'm not sucking my thumb, staring at the sun
Not the only one who's happy to go blind.
Green light, Seven Eleven,
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes.
You don't smoke, don't even want to.
Hey now, check your change.
Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down.
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive.
Oh, is that what it is?

Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground.
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around.
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip synch. to the talk shows.
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing.

If I could stay, then the night would give you up.
Stay, and the day would keep its trust.
Stay, and the night would be enough.

Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio.
With satellite television
You can go anywhere:
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin.

And, if you listen, I can't call.
And, if you jump, you just might fall.
And, if you shout, I'll only hear you.

If I could stay, then the night would give you up.
Stay, and the day would keep its trust.
Stay with the demons you drowned.
Stay with the spirit I found.
Stay, and the night would be enough.

Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet, there's no one around,
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground.
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel hits the ground.
There's a place I go
When I am far away.
There's a T.V. show
And I can play.

Sometimes when a hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Oh, oh, oh.

There's a picture book
With colour photographs
There's a comic strip
That makes me laugh

Sometimes away he takes me
Sometimes I don't let go.

Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys.

There's a place I go
And it's a part of me
There's a radio
And I will go

Sometimes a hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go.

Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys.
Stories for boys.
Stories for boys.

When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gonna put this back together
We won’t break
When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gonna put this back together
We won’t break

Sak Pase my Port au Princes
My Haitian gods and all of my princesses
Our condolences as you’re fighting against this
We’re right by your side while we try to make sense of this

Heavenly father, help us see through these problems
And those that left accept them in your garden
See here’s my theory
The country’s already starving
So we sacrifice many to shed light on all of them

Y’all please pardon me
I speak from my heart
It’s the only way I can see through this tragedy befallen them
So let’s get involved with them
Hand in hand with them
Arm in arm with them
Til they get strong again

When the sky falls		
Not tomorrow
Can’t wait until tomorrow

Haiti amie, mon amour, Haiti mon amour
Not gonna leave you stranded
Oh no, oh no, oh no

When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gonna put this back together
We won’t break
When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gonna put this back together
We won’t break


We learn from the past
New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can’t rely on the government
We under the rubble again
Who we going rumblin’ with
Who we gonna catch a break
A friend lost his mother, and then
Carlene
Lost her uncles, and then
And then buried with no caskets
They just put covers on them

And the tears fall, and we fight back
The story can’t end, no not like that
No not like this
This mob of survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us
Your memories alive with us
You who inspired us
To rebuild this country, you just guide us 

Not tomorrow
Can’t wait until tomorrow

Haiti amie mon amour, Haiti mon amour
Not leave gonna leave you stranded
Hey
Not gonna leave you stranded
Oh no, oh no

It’s not the angels that are on their way
It’s not the bells of Sainte Trinité
The people waiting
Position vacant for hands to help
Not just to pray

Haiti amie mon amour, Haiti mon amour
Not gonna leave you stranded
Hey
Not gonna leave you stranded
Oh no, oh no
Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.

We asked him to smile for a photograph
Waited a while to see if we could make him laugh.

The soldier asked for a cigarette
His smiling face I can't forget.
He looked at me across the street
But that's a long way here.

Oh, and I wish you were here.
Oh, and I wish you were here.

Stranger, stranger in a strange land.
He looked at me like I was the one who should run.

I watched as he watched us get back on the bus
I watched the way it was
The way it was when he was with us
And I really don't mind sleeping on the floor
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw
I wrote this letter to tell you the way I feel.

Oh I wish you were here
Oh I wish you were here
To see what I could see
To hear
And I wish you were here.
I'm not afraid of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me that I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find a decent melody
A song that I can sing in my own company

I never thought you were a fool
But darling, look at you
You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere, baby

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

I will not forsake, the colours that you bring
But the nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me
I still listen through your ears, and through your eyes I can see

And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough, and you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now... my oh my

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
Oh love look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it

I was unconscious, half asleep
The water is warm till you discover how deep...
I wasn't jumping... for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment and now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better now
You're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it

And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if our way should falter
Along the stony pass

And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along the stony pass
It's just a moment
This time will pass
I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away.
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cos tonight
We can be as one, tonight.

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead-end street.
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall.

Sunday, bloody Sunday.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.
Oh, let's go.

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trenches dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart.

Sunday, bloody Sunday.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cos tonight
We can be as one, tonight.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away.
I'll wipe your tears away.
I'll wipe your tears away.
I'll wipe your bloodshot eyes.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.
Sunday, bloody Sunday.

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality.
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die.

The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On...

Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday..

Oh, the city's alight with lovers and lies
And bright blue eyes.
Oh, the city is bright, it's brighter than day tonight.
(Surrender, surrender)
(Surrender, surrender)

Sadie said she couldn't work out what it was all about
And so she let go.
Now Sadie's on the street and the people she meets you know.

She tried to be a good girl and a good wife
Raise a good family
Lead a good life
It's not good enough
She got herself up on the 48th floor
Gotta find out
Find out what she's living for.

Oh, the city's afire
A passionate flame that knows me by name.
Oh, the city's desire to take me for more and more.
It's in the street gettin' under my feet
It's in the air, it's everywhere I look for you.
It's in the things that I do and say
And it I wanna live I gotta die to myself someday.

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud,
Ours is a stormy kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
But she won't catch me or break my fall.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love.
(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

(Oh, the sweetest thing.)

Ours is a stormy kind of love.

Here's to the Ronnie, the voice we adore
Like coals from a coal bucket scraping the floor
Sing out his praises in music and malt
And if you're not Irish, that isn't your fault

Raise up our voices like dogs in a pack
Thankful for honest men we never lack
We got in by twenties, we got in by ones
Them and their daughters and all of their sons

Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you

And what's it to any man whether or no'
Whether I'm easy or whether I'm true
As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow
And I tied up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe

Get up and go at it, five until five
When the whistle says budge it we come back alive
He'll sing to the heavens, he's stormy as hell
And wherever he goes, we'll be wishing him well

Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you

The dawn and the dust, the wise, the unjust
Kids in gambling games
The unheard, the unseen, the unwashed and unclean
Where the streets all have names
Baggers, street masons, street wagons to Stevens
With lovers and loners who can hear all intoners
The goths and the ravers, invalids and traders
Sing out Ronnie Drew

A life for a life or a hand for a hand
Trust in the music and strike up the band
The more that we sing the less that we fight
Time and again this is proved to be right

Build you a statue on St. Stephen's Green
No fairer monument ere to be seen
The statue of Ronnie Drew holding the hand
Of a girl with her hair in a black velvet band

Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
No stranger to devils or angles to tell
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew
A friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend to you
Ronnie Drew, we love you, yes we do
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you, Ronnie Drew
Here's to you, Ronnie Drew, here's to you, Ronnie Drew

And what's it to any man whether or no'
Whether I'm easy or whether I'm true
As I lifted her petticoat easy and slow
And I rolled up me sleeve for to buckle her shoe
Life begins with the first glance
The first kiss at the first dance
All of us are wondering why we’re here
In the crystal ballroom underneath the chandelier

Wet the glass till the glasses sing
We punish our hearts till the heart bells ring
Cos where we come from we’re not always kind
The human story is what love leaves behind

We’re the ghosts of love and we haunt this place
We’re the ghosts of love in every face
In the ballroom of the crystal lights
Everyone’s here with me tonight
Everyone but you

Our first chance, is their last dance
Our life is shaped by another’s hands
Buttoning unbuttoning her Coco dress
Stopping and unstopping every cold caress

Born for bliss, born for this
Every human life begins with a kiss
Kissed by every kind of possibility
And everyone is here tonight with me

We’re the ghosts of love and we haunt this place
We’re the ghosts of love in every face
In the ballroom of the crystal lights
Everyone’s here with me tonight

Everyone but you
Everyone but you
Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to.

Toy, broken toy
Shout, shout, you're inside out
If you don't know.
Electric Co.
If you don't know
Electric Co.

Red, running red
Play for real
Talk and feel
Holding your head
You won't shout
You still beg
If you don't know
The Electric Co.

If you don't know.
Electric Co.
If you don't know
Electric Co.

I have a lover, a lover like no other
She got soul, soul, soul, sweet soul
And she teach me how to sing.

Shows me colours when there's none to see
Gives me hope when I can't believe
That for the first time I feel love.

I have a brother, when I'm a brother in need
I spend my whole time running
He spends his running after me.

I feel myself goin' down
I just call and he comes around.
But for the first time I feel love.

My father is a rich man, he wears a rich man's cloak.
He gave me the keys to his kingdom (coming)
Gave me a cup of gold.

He said "I have many mansions
And there are many rooms to see."
But I left by the back door
And I threw away the key
And I threw away the key.

For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, I feel love. 
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight.
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y' know I don't see you when she walks in the room.

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help.
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else.
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child.

All my life, I worshipped her
Her golden voice, her beauty's beat
How she made us feel
How she made me real
And the ground beneath her feet
And the ground beneath her feet

And now I can't be sure of anything
Black is white, and cold is heat
For what I worshipped stole my love away
It was the ground beneath her feet
It was the ground beneath her feet

Go lightly down your darkened way
Go lightly underground
I'll be down there in another day
I won't rest until you're found

Let me love you true, let me rescue you
Let me lead you to where two roads meet
O come back above
Where there's only love
And the ground beneath her feet
And the ground beneath her feet 
Oh my love 
It’s a long way we’ve come
From the freckled hills to the steel and glass canyons
From the stony fields, to hanging steel from the sky
From digging in our pockets, for a reason not to say goodbye

These are the hands that built America
Russian, Sioux, Dutch, Hindu
Polish, Irish, German, Italian

I last saw your face in a watercolour sky
As sea birds argued a long goodbye
I took your kiss on the spray of the new line star
You gotta live with your dreams
Don’t make them so hard

And these are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America
The Irish, the Blacks, the Chinese, the Jews
Korean, Hispanic, Muslim, Indian

Of all of the promises
Is this one we can keep?
Of all of the dreams
 Is this one still out of reach?

Its early fall
There’s a cloud on the New York skyline
Innocence dragged across a yellow line
These are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America
Shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky

It's no secret that the stars
Are falling from the sky
It's no secret that I left you
And still I don't know why
You say the sun is sometimes
Eclipsed by a moon
You know I'd come back, baby
If you gave me some room

It's no secret that a friend
Is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar
Won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something
You tell one other person
What do you think
Child...

Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky

A man will beg
A man will crawl
But it's never too late
To take his call
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
And everyone needs music 'cause everyone needs relief

Love...live like a shining star
She calls, the sun will burn

A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky
Tonight...

Love...you shine like a burning star
You're falling from the sky

A man will rise
A man will fall

From the sheer face of love

The universe expolded 'cause one man told a lie
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange

Love...shine like a fading sky
She holds one love, the sky

I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near, 
Your voice was all I heard 
I was shaking from a storm in me, 
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see 
Yeah I wanted to be the melody, 
Above the noise, above the hurt.

I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I’d ever heard.

We got language so we can’t communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain, and give it a name

I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
In the most beautiful sound I’d ever heard.

We can hear you
We can hear you
We can hear you

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
I get so many things I don’t deserve
All the stolen voices will someday be returned
The most beautiful sound I’d ever heard

Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
A picture in grey
Dorian Gray
Just me by the sea.

And I felt like a star
I felt the world could go far
If they listened to what I said.
The sea

Washes my fee
Washes my fee
Splashes the sole of my shoes.
If coke is a mystery
Michael Jackson, history
If beauty is truth
And surgery the fountain of youth...

What am I to do?
Have I got the gifts to get me through
The gates of that mansion?

If O.J. is more than a drink
And a Big Mac bigger than you think
And perfume is an obsession
And talk showsÃ– confession

What have we got to lose?
Another push and we'll be through
The gates of that mansion.

I never bought a lotto ticket
I never parked in anyone's space.
The banks they're like cathedrals
I guess casinos took their place.

Love, come on down
Don't wake her she'll come around.

Chance is a kind of religion
Where you're damned for plain hard luck.
I never did see that movie
I never did read that book.
Love, come on down
Let my numbers come around.

Don't know if I can hold on
Don't know if I'm that strong.
Don't know if I can wait that long
Till the colours come flashing
And the lights go on.

Then will there be no time for sorrow
Then will there be no time for shame
Though I can't say why
I know I've got to believe.

We'll go driving in that pool
It's who you know that gets you through
The gates of the playboy mansion.

Then will there be no time for sorrow
Then will there be no time for shame
Then will there be now time for shame
Then will there be now time for pain
Wa, war she's the refugee.
I see your face, I see you staring back at me.
Wa, war she is the refugee.
Her mama say one day she's gonna live in America.

In the morning she is waiting
Waiting for the ship to sail, sail away.

Wa, war her papa go to war.
He gonna fight but he don't know what for.
Wa, war her papa go to war.
Her mama say one day he's gonna come back from far away.

Oh help me
How can you help me?

In the evening
She is waiting
Waiting for her man to come
And take her by her hand
And take her to this promised land.

Wa, war she's a pretty face
But at the wrong time in the wrong place
Wa, war she's a pretty face
Her mama say one days she's gonna live in America.
Yeah, America.

Wa, war she is a refugee.
She coming back, she come and keep you company.
Wa, war she is a refugee.
Her mama say one day she's gonna live in America. 
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy
God, I know I'm one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone, how long now
Until the clouds unroll and you come home, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

I cried to my daddy on the telephone, how long now

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now
Until a weather change condemns belief, how long now
When the night watchman lets in the thief, what's wrong now?

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control 

You think it’s easier 
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think it’s easier
To know your own tricks
Well it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do

I have a will for survival 
So you can hurt me and then hurt me some more
I can live with denial 
But you’re not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control

You think it’s easier 
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
You think it’s easier
But before you threw me a rope 
It was the one thing I could hold on to

I have a will for survival 
So you can hurt me then hurt me some more
I can live with denial 
But you’re not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control

God knows it’s not easy
Taking on the shape of someone else’s pain
God now you can see me
I’m naked and I’m not afraid
My body’s sacred and I’m not ashamed

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control
You think it’s easier
To get your fingers out of trouble
When the trouble is you
You think it’s easier
To keep your hands out of trouble
When the trouble is you

I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me, then hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you’re not my troubles anymore

Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
Somebody stop the world I’m on

Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say

I stepped outside like I had never seen the night before
Looking at the stars that never looked so bright before
This crooked heart it never felt so light before
A brand new man, I’m a brand new man

Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody stop the world I’m on
Somebody throw a line to me,
Somebody tell me what to say
Ice, your only rivers run cold.
These city lights, they shine as silver and gold.
Dug from the night, your eyes as black as coal.

Walk on by, walk on through.
Walk till you run and don't look back
For here I am.

Carnival, the wheels fly and the colours spin through alcohol.
Red wine that punctures the skin.
Face to face in a dry and waterless place.

Walk on by, walk on through.
So sad to besiege your love oh hang on.

Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie.
I'm only asking, but I, I think you know.
Come on take me away, come on take me away
Come on take me home, home again.

And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no not I.

Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie.
Ever after is a long time.
And if you save your love, save it all, save it all
Don't push me too far, don't push me too far.
Tonight, tonight.
I went out walking through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye.

Yeah, I went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.
I went wandering.

I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in.
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit.
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it.

I went out riding down that old eight-lane
I passed a thousand signs looking for my own name.
I went with nothing but the thought you'd be there too,
Looking for you.

I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel as much
As a man can before he repents.

I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand.
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one.

Now Jesus, don't you wait up, Jesus I'll be home soon.
Yeah, I went out for the papers, told her I'd be back by noon.
Yeah, I left with nothing but the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you.

Yeah, I went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.
I went wandering.

Soldier soldier
We signed our lives away
Complete surrender
The only weapon we know
Soldier soldier
We knew the world would never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now

We come from an ancient place
Beyond what we can see
We’ve come to colonise your night 
And steal your poetry

Old man knows that I never listen
So how could I have something to say
Old man knows how to cheat ambition
You don’t lose if you don’t play

1, 2, 3, 4, was enough

Soldier soldier
We signed our lives away
Complete surrender
The only weapon we know
Soldier soldier
We knew the world would never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now

On a double decker bus
Into College Square
If you won’t let us in your world
Your world just isn’t there

Old man says that we never listen
We shout about what we don’t know
We’re taking the path of most resistance
The only way for us to go, 

hup, 2, 3, 4, was enough

Soldier soldier
We signed our lives away
Complete surrender
The only weapon we know
Soldier soldier
We knew the world will never be the same
Soldier this is where you can reach me now

This is the site
This is the season
This is where you can reach me now
This is the time
This is the number
This is where you can reach me now
Won't you come back tomorrow
Won't you come back tomorrow
Won't you come back tomorrow
Can I sleep tonight?

Outside, somebody's outside
Somebody's knocking at the door.
There's a black car parked at the side of the road
Don't go to the door
Don't go to the door.

I'm going out.
I'm going outside mother.
I'm going out there.

Won't you be back tomorrow,
Won't you be back tomorrow,
Will you be back tomorrow?
Can I sleep tonight?

Who broke the window
Who broke down the door?
Who tore the curtain
And who was it for?
Who heals the wounds
Who heals the scars?
Open the door, open the door.

Won't you come back tomorrow?
Won't you be back tomorrow?
Will you be back tomorrow?
Can I sleep tonight?

'Cause I want you
I, I want you
I really want you.
I, I want, I, I
Want you to be back tomorrow
I want you to be back tomorrow.
Will you be back tomorrow?
Can I sleep tonight?

I want you to be back tomorrow
I want you to be back tomorrow.
Will you be back tomorrow?
Open up, open up, to the Lamb Of God
To the love of He
Who made the blind to see.

He's coming back
He's coming back
O believe Him.
Thank-you, don't mention it.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I don't think I'm very good at this
Let me show you, I just wanna know, I just wanna know.

Falling, the world is by your side
Calling, to find a place to hide
I just wanna know
I just wanna know.

She said "The twenty second floor"
I said "I can't think what it's for"
And I just wanna know
I just wanna know.

Touching you, touching you, etc.
I know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
And she won't tell me her name

I know a boy
A boy called Trash, Trash Can
I know he does all that he can, wham bam
And she won't tell me his name

When I was three
I thought the world revolved around me
I was wrong
But you can sing, sing along
And if you dance
Then dance with me

I know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl

I know a boy
A boy called Trampoline
You know what I mean
I think you know what he wants
I think he knows what he wants
I think he knows what he wants
I like to smile
But I like to mostly stay with you
I like good times
But I can't feel this without you
By my song
The heart is in the place
I sing this song
Probably so

If I could sigh
I'd tell the world I'd felt with you
I like the time
I like the feeling when
I feel you in my arms
I'll take you in my hand
I'll let you go
Somebody save me
Somebody save me

Sing it
Sing my, sing my song
We sing the same old song loud

Smile
Though your heart breaks in two
Touch me
When will I be with you

I like good times
But I can feel it's going wrong
You sing the same old song
Now I think it's time to get it right

Sing it out, sing out...
Sing this same old song

If I could swim, I'd swim in circles
If I could drown, I'd, I'd drown with you
If I had enough of my life
I can't tell
If I had enough of you 
In the distance, she saw me comin' round
I was callin' out, I was callin' out.
Still shakin', still in pain
You put me back together again.
I was cold and you clothed me, honey
I was down, and you lifted me, honey.

Angel, angel or devil?
I was thirsty
And you wet my lips.
You, I'm waiting for you
You, you set my desire
I trip through your wires.

I was broken, bent out of shape
I was naked in the clothes you made.
Lips were dry, throat like rust
You gave me shelter from the heat and the dust.
No more water in the well
No more water, water.

Angel, angel or devil?
I was thirsty
And you wet my lips.
You, I'm waiting for you
You, you set my desire
I trip through your wires.

Oh I need, oh I need
Oh I need, oh I need it.
Oh I need, oh I need
All I need, yeah, yeah!

Thunder, thunder on the mountain
There's a raincloud
In the desert sky.
In the distance
She saw me comin' round
I was callin' out
I was callin' out.
Six o'clock in the morning, you're the last to hear the warning
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world.
You been falling off the sidewalk, your lips move but you can't talk
Tryin' to throw your arms around the world.

Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you; be still.
Gonna run to you, run to you, woman, I will. 

Sunrise like a nose-bleed, your head hurts and you can't breathe
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world.
How far are you gonna go before you lose your way back home
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world.

Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you; be still.
Gonna run to you, run to you, woman, I will. 

Yeah I dreamed that I saw Dali with a supermarket trolley
He was tryin' to throw his arms around a girl.
He took an open top beetle through the eye of a needle
He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world.

I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you, woman be still.
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you, woman, I will.

Nothing much to say, I guess; just the same as all the rest
Been tryin' to throw your arms round the world.
And a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle
When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world.

Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you, woman be still
Woman be still, woman be still, woman I will.
I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something.
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry.

My body grows and grows
It frightens me, you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known.

Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play.
It's all, it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something.
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry.

My body grows and grows
It frightens me, you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known.

Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play.
It's all, it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.
I don't know, I don't know which side I'm on.
I don't know my right from left or my right from wrong.
They say I'm a fool, they say I'm nothing
But if I'm a fool for you oh, that's something.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts.

I can't stop to dance
Honey, this is my last chance
I said, can't stop to dance
Maybe this is my last chance.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts.

Beat on black, beat on white
Beat on anything, don't get it right.
Beat on you, beat on me, beat on love.

I don't know
How to say what's got to be said
I don't know if it's black or white
There's others see it red
I don't get the answers right
I'll leave that to you
Is this love out of fashion
Or is it the time of year?
Are these words distraction
To the words you wanna hear?
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts.

I try to spit it out
Try to explain.
The way I wanna feel
Oh, yeah, two hearts.

Well I can't stop to dance.
Maybe this is my last chance.
And I said, I can't stop to dance.
Maybe this is my last chance.
I said don't stop to dance
Maybe this is my last chance.
I said I can't stop to dance.
Maybe this is our last chance.
I said don't stop to dance.
Maybe this is our last chance.
Oh, oh!
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
You think I'm no good
Well I know I've been bad
Took you to a place
Now you, can't get back
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Walk together 
Down a dead end street
We were mixing the bitter
With the sweet
Don't try to figure out
What we might have had
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad

I'm just a singer
Some say a sinner
Rollin' the dice
Not always a winner
You say I've been lucky
Well hell!, I made my own
Not part of the crowd
But not feeling alone

Under pressure
But not bent out of shape
Surrounded
We always found an escape
Drove me to drink
But hey, thats not all bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Guess I've been greedy
All of my life
Greedy with my children
My lovers, my wife
Greedy for the good things
As well as the bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Maybe it's just talk
Saloon singing
The chairs are all stacked
The swingers stopped swinging
You say I hurt you
You put the finger on yourself
Then after you did it
You came crying for my help

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
I'm not complaining
Baby, I'm glad
You call it compromise
Well whats that ?
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad

Two shots of happy
One shot 
Of sad 
Sometimes I feel like I don't know
Sometimes I feel like checking out.
I wanna get it wrong
Can't always be strong
And love, it won't be long.

Oh, sugar, don't you cry.
Oh, child, wipe the tears from your eyes.
You know I need you to be strong
And the day it is dark, as the night is long.
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean.
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen.

Baby, baby, baby, light my way.
Alright now, baby, baby, baby, light my way.

You bury your treasure where it can't be found
But your love is a secret that's been passed around.
There is a silence that comes to a house
Where no-one can sleep.
I guess it's the price of love; I know it's not cheap.

Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way.
Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way
Baby, baby, baby, light my way.

I remember when we could sleep on stones.
Now we lie together in whispers and moans.
When I was all messed up and I heard opera in my head
Your love was a light bulb hanging over my bed.

Baby, baby, baby, light my way.
Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way.
Oh, oh my love
Oh my darling
I've hunger for your touch
A long and lonely time

And time goes by 
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine ?

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea

Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me

Oh, oh my love
Oh my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long and lonely time

And time goes by 
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine ?

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me 
It to me
God speed your love to me
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love 
Sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I was lost between the midnight and the dawning
In a place of no consequence or company
3:33 when the numbers fell off the clock face
Speed dialling with no signal at all

Go, shout it out, rise up
Oh, oh
Escape yourself, and gravity
Hear me, cease to speak that I may speak
Shush now
Oh, oh
Force quit and move to trash

I was right there at the top of the bottom
On the edge of the known universe where I wanted to be
I had driven to the scene of the accident
And I sat there waiting for me

Restart and re-boot yourself
You're free to go
Oh, oh
Shout for joy if you get the chance
Password, you, enter here, right now

Oh, oh
You know your name so punch it in
Hear me, cease to speak that I may speak
Shush now
Oh, oh
Then don't move or say a thing
Haven't seen you in quite a while
I was down the hold, just passing time.
Last time we met it was a low-lit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom.
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time except you.
You were talking about the end of the world.

I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think.
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of surprise.
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart.
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world.


In my dream, I was drowning my sorrows
But my sorrows they'd learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy.
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy.
You, you said you'd wait till the end of the world.
Hold me now, oh hold me now
Till this hour has gone around
And I gone, on the rising tide
For to face Van Diemen's land.

It's a bitter pill I swallow here
To be rent from one so dear.
We fought for justice and not for gain
But the magistrate sent me away.

Now kings will rule and the poor will toil
And tear their hands as they tear the soil
But a day will come in this dawning age
When an honest man sees an honest wage.

Hold me now, oh hold me now
Till this hour has gone around
And I'm gone on the rising tide
For to face Van Diemen's Land.

Unos dos tres catorce!

Lights go down, it's dark 
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart 
A feeling is so much stronger than 
A thought 
Your eyes are wide 
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello hello 
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know 
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the 
Boys play rock and roll
They know they can't dance 
At least they knowâ.

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Oh oh oh oh

Hello hello 
I'm at a place called Vertigo
It's everything I wish I didn't know 
But you give me something I can feel, feel





Check mated
Oh yeah
Hours of funâ

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours

All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurtâ.

Hello hello 
We're at a place called Vertigo
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something 

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how, how to kneelâ

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin to hold on
To what you used to be
I’m so glad the past is all gone?
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?

Volcano, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know.
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know

Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you don’t see so well
The future’s gonna land on you

Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?

Volcano, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know.
Volcano 
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano

You were alone, 
Now you’re not alone
You were alone
But now
YOU ARE ROCK N ROLL
YOU AND I ARE ROCK N ROLL
YOU ARE ROCK N ROLL
YOU AND I ARE ROCK N ROLL

Volcano, you don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know.
Volcano 
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don’t wanna, you don’t wanna know
You’re on a piece of ground above a volcano
Jesus, Jesus help me
I'm alone in this world
And a fucked-up world it is too.

Tell me, tell me the story
The one about eternity
And the way it's all gonna be.

Wake up, wake up dead man
Wake up, wake up dead man.

Jesus, I'm waiting here, boss
I know you're looking out for us
But maybe your hands aren't free.

Your Father, He made the world in seven
He's in charge of heaven.
Will you put a word in for me?

Wake up, wake up dead man
Wake up, wake up dead man.

Listen to the words they'll tell you what to do
Listen over the rhythm that's confusing you
Listen to the reed in the saxophone
Listen over the hum of the radio
Listen over the sound of blades in rotation
Listen through the traffic and circulation
Listen as hope and peace try to rhyme
Listen over marching bands playing out their time.

Wake up, wake up dead man
Wake up, wake up dead man.

Jesus, were you just around the corner?
Did you think to try and warn her?
Were you working on something new?
If there's an order in all of this disorder
Is it like a tape recorder?
Can we rewind it just once more?

Wake up, wake up dead man
Wake up, wake up dead man.
Wake up, wake up dead man.
And love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring...
And love is not the easy thing....
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind

And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
And for a second you turn back
Oh no, be strong

Walk on, walk on
What you got they can't steal it
No they can't even feel it
Walk on, walk on...
Stay safe tonight

You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been
A place that has to be believed to be seen
You could have flown away
A singing bird in an open cage
Who will only fly, only fly for freedom

Walk on, walk on
What you've got they can't deny it
Can't sell it, can't buy it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight

And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on, walk on

Home, hard to know what it is if you've never had one
Home, I can't say where it is but I know I'm going home
That's where the hurt is

I know it aches
How your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on, walk on

Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you steal
All this you can leave behind
All that you reason
All that you sense
All that you speak
All you dress up
All that you scheme.
She said it wasn't cold
She left her coat unbuttoned
She wore canvas shoes
White canvas shoes
Around her neck
She wore a silver necklace
'It was given to me by my father' she said
'It was given to me'

She took the back way home
Past the lights at Summerhill
Turn left on to the north strand
And on 
On towards the sea

He said he was an artist
But he really painted billboards
In large capital letters
In large capital letters
He was telling jokes
Nobody else would listen to him

I saw you that day
Your lips were cherry red
Your legs were crossed your arms wide open
Your hair was coloured gold
And like a field of corn
You were blown by the wind
You were blown by the wind

Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me awhile
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
walk with me in a light

A room in the Royal hotel
With sea facing views
A man with a suitcase
Full of things he doesn't need
I'm looking through your window
I'm walking through your doorway
I'm on the outside
Let me in

Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me

Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
walk with me a while 
When you look at the world
What is it that you see?
People find all kinds of things
That bring them to their knees
I see an expression
So clear and so true
That it changes the atmosphere
When you walk into the room

So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world

When the night is someone elses
And you're trying to get some sleep
When your thoughts are too expensive
To ever want to keep
When there's all kinds of chaos
And everyone is walking lame
You don't even blink now, do you
Or even look away

So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world

I can't wait any longer
I can't wait till I'm stronger
Can't wait any longer
To see what you see
When I look at the world

I'm in the waiting room
Can't see for the smoke
I think of you and your holy book
While the rest of us choke

Tell me, tell me, what do you see?
Tell me, tell me, what's wrong with me 
I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me.
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said.

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town.

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget.
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town.

I ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream.
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town.

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town.

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town.

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword.
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide.

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame.
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town.
Did you get it
Did you need it
Did you really
What you wanted
Was it good in the sun
Did you really have the fun

Did you crack it
Did you grab it
Did you reel it
Like a rabbit
Did you rock
Did you roll
Did you move yourself along
And how could you do
And did you see me sing this song
Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong

Did you grab it
Did you want it
Is it really what you wanted
Did you run in the sun
Did you imitate a walk

Did you answer
Did you grab it
Did you gun it like a rabbit
Did you walk
Did you run
Can you feel you rising up

And how can you do
And when you sang it in the song
And it sank, and it threw
Where did it all go wrong

Did you drown it
Did you roll it
Did you smash it
Did you warm it
Did you clean it
Clean it up
Did you rub it
Did you soap

Did you screen it
Did you ream it
Did you ruin it
Did you feed it
Is it warm in the sun
When the weather's getting warm

And the worlds at your feet
And it is our time to say
It's all gone wrong
Where did it all go wrong
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

You take me, baby, in circles, dancing
Darling, darling, darling...I want you
Why oh, why oh, why oh...stony rose
You lose your guy
You walk on by
You walk on by
You walk on by
You walk on by
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy 
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside.
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name.

I wanna feel sunlight on my face.
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace.
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust.
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust.
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name.

We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love.
And when I go there
I go there with you
(It's all I can do).
Where I came from there were no hills at all
The land was flat, the highway straight and wide
My brother and I would drive for hours
Like we had years instead of days
Our faces as pale as the dirty snow

Once I knew there was a love divine
Then came a time I thought it knew me not
Who can forgive forgiveness where forgiveness is not
Only the lamb as white as snow

And the water, it was icy
As it washed over me
And the moon shone above me

Now this dry ground it bears no fruit at all
Only poppies laugh under the crescent moon
The road refuses strangers
The land the seeds we sow
Where might we find the lamb as white as snow

As boys we would go hunting in the woods
To sleep the night shooting out the stars
Now the wolves are every passing stranger
Every face we cannot know
If only a heart could be as white as snow
If only a heart could be as white as snow
You're dangerous, 'cos you're honest.
You're dangerous, you don't know what you want.
Well you left my heart empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt.

You're an accident waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass left there on a beach.
Well you tell me things
I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me just out of reach.

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?

Well you stole it 'cos I needed the cash
And you killed it 'cos I needed revenge.
Well you lied to me 'cos I asked you to.
Baby, can we still be friends?

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?

Ah, the deeper I spin
Ah, the hunter will sin for your ivory skin.
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees, the river laughing at you and me.
Hallelujah! Heaven's white rose
The doors you open I just can't close.

Don't turn around, don't turn around again.
Don't turn around your gypsy heart.
Don't turn around, don't turn around again.
Don't turn around, and don't look back.
Come on now love, don't you look back.

Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna taste your saltwater kisses?
Who's gonna take the place of me?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna tame the heart of thee?
In the days
When we were swinging from the trees
I was a monkey
Stealing honey from a swarm of bees
I could taste
I could taste you even then
And I would chase you down the wind

You could go there if you please
Wild honey
And if you go there, go with me
Wild honey

Did I know you?
Did I know you even then?
Before the clocks kept time
Before the world was made

From the cruel sun
You were shelter
You were my shelter and my shade

If you go there with me
Wild honey
You can do just what you please
Wild honey
Yeah, just blowing in the breeze
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild

I'm still standing, I'm still standing
Where you left me
Are you still growing wild
With everything tame around you?

I send you flowers
Cut flowers for your hall
I know your garden's full
But is there sweetness at all?

oh oh oh

If you go there with me
Wild honey
Won't you take me, take me please
Wild honey
Yeah, swinging through the trees
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild 
The shackles are undone
The bullets quit the gun
The heat that's in the sun
Will keep us when there's none
The rule has been disproved
The stone it has been moved
The grave is now a groove
All debts are removed

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's done to me?

Love makes strange enemies
Makes love where love may please
The soul and its striptease
Hate brought to its knees
The sky over our head
We can reach it from our bed
You let me in your heart
And out of my head, head

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's done to me?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Please don't ever let me out of you

I've got no shame, oh no, oh no

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see?     
Oh can't you see what love has done?       
What it's doing to me?

I know I hurt you and I made you cry 
Did everything but murder you and I         
But love left a window in the skies             
And to love I rhapsodize
To every broken heart
For every heart that cries
Love left a window in the skies
And to love I rhapsodize
Innocent, and in a sense I am
Guilty of the crime that's now in hand
Such a nice day
Throw your life away
Such a nice day 
Let it go

Cold these eyes, I can't believe it
Cold, this heart is slow
Heart is stone

Call me
Such a cold heart
Such a cold man 
Watch you tear your self apart

So lay me down
My soul to give
So lay me down
The longest sleep
Oh, the longest sleep

In I come and out you go you get
Here we are again now, place your bets
Is this the time
The time to win or lose
Is this the time
The time to choose

Cold these eyes, I can't believe it
So deep inside a cold fire
Cold, this heart is slow...
Heart is stone

Any time your on there
(Kiss me...)
Won't you tell me
That's it just give me it

In some white track
You come right back
Cartoon cutout
Cut throat let out
I'm on your side
Be on the both side
I'm on right track
You get off my back
I'm no dope
I give you hope
Here's the rope
Here's the rope
Now...swing away

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side.
I wait for you.
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I waitÃ– without you

With or without you
With or without you.

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You gave it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for youÃ–

With or without you
With or without you.
I can't live with or without you.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing else to lose.

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you.

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you. 
Oh, where do we go,
Where do we go from here?
Where to go?
To the side of a hill
Blood was spilt
We were still looking at each other.
But we're going back there?

Jerusalem
Jerusalem

Shout, shout, with a shout
Shout it out, shout
Shout it out.

I want to go, to the foot of Mount Zion
To the foot of He who made me see
To the side of a hill blood was spilt
We were filled with a love
And we're going to be there again

Jerusalem
Jerusalem

Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem

Shout, shout, with a shout
Shout, with a shout. 
Take these shoes
Click clacking down some dead end street
Take these shoes
And make them fit
Take this shirt
Polyester white trash made in nowhere 
Take this shirt 
And make it clean, clean
Take this soul
Stranded in some skin and bones
Take this soul 
And make it sing

Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, Yahweh
Still I'm waiting for the dawn

Take these hands 
Teach them what to carry
Take these hands
Don't make a fist
Take this mouth 
So quick to criticise
Take this mouth
Give it a kiss

Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahewh, Yahweh
Still I'm waiting for the dawn

Still waiting for the dawn, the sun is coming up
The sun is coming up on the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean

Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, tell me now
Why the dark before the dawn?

Take this city
A city should be shining on a hill
Take this city
If it be your will
What no man can own, no man can take
Take this heart
Take this heart
Take this heart 
And make it break

It's time to go again
To your blue room
Got some questions to ask of you
In your blue room

The air is clean
Your skin is clear
I've had enough of
hanging round here
It's a different kind of conversation
In your blue room

Saw me coming
In and outside
Saw me coming
Somewhere to hide

And time is a string of pearls
Your blue room
Once again
See the future just hanging there
Your blue room
A new frame
A new perspective
Looking down on my objectives
Your instructions
Whatever their directions
Your blue room

Saw me coming
East by the moon
Saw me coming
Can you feel

(It's allright)

Your blue room

One day I'll be back
Your blue room
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at
Your blue room

We see me slide down
Won't you give me a home
So much for change

Zooming in
Zooming out
Nothing I can't do without
A lense to it all up close
To Magnify what no one knows
Never in company
Never alone
No car alarm
No cellular phone 
I'm ready
Ready for the laughing gas
I'm ready
Ready for what's next
Ready to duck
Ready to dive
Ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
Ready for the push

In the cool of the night
In the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling around
On my hands and knees

She's just down the line ... Zoo Station
Got to make it on time ... Zoo Station

I'm ready
Ready for the gridlock
I'm ready
To take it to the street
Ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go
Of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright ... it's alright ... it's alright ... it's alright
Hey baby ... hey baby ... hey baby ... hey baby ...
It's alright
It's alright

Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass

I'm just down the line from your love ... Zoo Station
Under the sign of your love ... Zoo Station
I'm gonna be there ... Zoo Station
Tracing the line ... Zoo Station
I'm gonna make it on time ... make it on time ... Zoo Station
Just two stops down the line ... Zoo Station
Just a stop down the line ... Zoo Station 
Zooropa... Vorsprung durch Technik
Zooropa... be all that you can be
Be a winner
Eat to get slimmer

Zooropa... a bluer kind of white
Zooropa... it could be yours tonight
We're mild and green
And squeaky clean

Zooropa... better by design
Zooropa... fly the friendly skies
Through appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence...

And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I have no reasons
No reasons to get back

And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we've got

Zooropa... Don't worry baby, it'll be alright
Zooropa... You got the right shoes
Zooropa... To get you through the night
Zooropa... It's cold outside, but brightly lit
Zooropa... Skip the subway
Zooropa... Let's go to the overground
Get your head out of the mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby
Overground

No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from?

Zooropa... Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright
Zooropa... Uncertainty... can be a guiding light
Zooropa... I hear voices, ridiculous voices
Zooropa... In the slipstream
Zooropa... Let's go, let's go... overground
Zooropa... Take your head out of the mud baby

She's gonna dream up
The world she wants to live in
She's gonna dream out loud

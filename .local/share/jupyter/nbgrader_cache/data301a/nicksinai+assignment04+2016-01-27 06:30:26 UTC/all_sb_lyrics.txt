Back of the room Looking at you Counting the steps Between us A hundred and five Little blades in a line From your skin to mine And I feel it Eyes on the ground But I can't look up now Don't wanna give it away My secret In another life,  my teeth and tongue Would speak aloud what until now  I've only sung 'Cause I would die to make you mine Bleed me dry each and every time I don't mind, no I don't mind it I would come back a thousand times You can make me wait forever Push me away and tell me never I don't mind, no I don't mind it I would come back a thousand times Kiss me goodnight Like a good friend might I'll do the same But won't mean it 'Cause love is a cage These words on a page Carry the pain They don't free it In another life  I wouldn't need to Console myself  as I resign to,  release you 'Cause I would die to make you mine Bleed me dry each and every time I don't mind, no I don't mind it I would come back a thousand times You can make me wait forever Push me away and tell me never I don't mind, no I don't mind it I would come back a thousand times Again again  I let it go, let it go Cover my mouth  don't let a single word slip Out wouldn't wanna tell you, no tell you, no Nothing could be worse  than the risk of Losing what I don't have now And we could buy the minute, though is it so bad If I wanna cry out That I would die to make you mine Bleed me dry almost every time But I don't mind, no I don't mind it I would come back a thousand times Make me wait forever Push me away and tell me never But I don't mind, no I don't mind it I would come back a thousand times I would come back a thousand times   I would come back a thousand times

Oh let him go bluebird. Oh let him go bluebird. Oh let him go bluebird. Ready to fly, You and I, Here we go Here we go

Come in close now, it's time to tell a story Long ago and so many years before we Ever were, ever dreamed we even could be There was her and her very first heartbeat All alone in the corner of the night sky Spiral bones of a supernova starlight Fell in love with another burning bright she Dreamed of a way to ignite she said, Tonight Come on, come on  collide Break me to pieces, I I think you're just like heaven why Come on, come on collide Let's see what a fire feels like I bet it's just like heaven Just like heaven Just like heaven Such a shame   nowhere near, even the near mist light years away From the hope of being sun-kissed  anchored home in her interstellar sea but, poor lonely Cassiopeia So she sighs and she burns with desperation Learns to cry over love of constellations Then the spark from a star shooting too close They both smiled  what a day to explode, she said Tonight Come on, come on collide Break me to pieces, I I think you're just like heaven why Come on, come on collide Let's see what a fire feels like I bet it's just like heaven Just like heaven Just like heaven Long ago in a sky built before us A supernova grew up to be stardust
Itâs a really old city Stuck between the dead and the living So I thought to myself, Sitting on a graveyard shelf As the echo of heartbeats, From the ground below my feet Filled a cemetery In the center of Queens I started running the maze of The names and the dates, some Older than others  the skyscrapers, little tombstone brothers With Manhattan behind her, three million stunning reminders Built a cemetery In the center of Queens You said, remember that life is Not meant to be wasted We can always be chasing the sun! So fill up your lungs and just run But always be chasing the sun! So how do you do it, With just words and just music, Capture the feeling  that my earth is somebodyâs ceiling Can I deliver in sound The weight of the ground Of a cemetery In the center of Queens Thereâs a history through her   Sent to us as a gift from the future To show us the proof More than that, itâs to dare us to move And to open our eyes and to learn from the sky From a cemetery In the center of Queens You said, remember that life is Not meant to be wasted We can always be chasing the sun! So fill up your lungs and just run But always be chasing the sun! All we can do is try And live like weâre still alive Itâs a really old city Stuck between the dead and the living So I thought to myself Sitting on a graveyard shelf And the gift of my heartbeat sounds like a symphony Played by a cemetery in the center of Queens You said, remember that life is Not meant to be wasted We can always be chasing the sun! So fill up your lungs and just run But always be chasing the sun! All we can do is try And live like weâre still alive All we can do is try And live like weâre still alive
There's a harvest each Saturday night At the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride A place you can stand for one night and get gone  It's clear this conversation ain't doing a thing Cause these boys only listen to me when I sing And I don't feel like singing tonight All the same songs  In these deep city lights Girl could get lost tonight I'm finding every reason to be gone Nothing here to hold on to Could I hold you?  The situation's always the same You got your wolves in their clothes whispering Hollywood's name Stealing gold from the silver they see But it's not me  In these deep city lights Girl could get lost tonight I'm finding every reason to be gone Nothing here to hold on to Could I hold you?  Calling out somebody save me I feel like I'm fading away Calling out somebody save me I feel like I'm fadingÃ¢? ¦ I'm fading  In these deep city lights Girl could get lost tonight I'm finding every reason to be gone Nothing here to hold on to Could I hold you?
I could use another cigarette. But don't worry daddy, I'm not addicted yet. One too many drinks tonight and I miss you, Like you were mine Your stormy words have barely broken And you sound like thunder though you've barely spoken Oh, it looks like rain tonight and thank God, Cause a clear sky just wouldn't feel right. [Chorus] He's taken and leaving but I keep believing He's gonna come round soon Till I see him again I'm staying believing That it won't be deceiving when he's gonna come round soon. You may be my final match. 'Cause I chase everything when you play throw and I play catch It never took much to keep me satisfied But all this bullshit you feed me you miss me you need me This hungry heart will not subside [Chorus] Well I may seem naive if I cry as you leave like I'm just one more tortured heart But baby don't be fooled. Cause these cracks that I show as I'm watching you go aren't tearing me apart And I know I'll see you soon The angels said I'd smile today. Aw well who needs angels anyway? [Chorus]
Afternoon has settled long and heavy on my shoulders The winter's light feels different on my skin It doesn't seem to strike as far below the surface so I have to conclude that shadow won't let it in Shadow won't let it in Shadow won't let it in December You've always been a problem child December You run me down right restless and wild and I remember When you used to be mine December oh December oh The leaves are all still changing, the weather here is mild and vacant A winter's blooming on Los Angeles The artificial cold is more than I was hoping for but not enough to consume The darkened state I'm in The darkened state I'm in The darkened state I'm in December You've always been a problem child December You run me down right restless and wild and I remember When you used to be mine December oh December oh Distill a whole year down into a day Act like we all start over with a pristine slate But to get yourself a new life you've got to give the other one away And I'm starting to believe in the power of a name 'Cause it can't be a mistake if I just call it change December oh (Can't turn around now) December (Can't turn around now) (Can't turn around now) December (Break the chain, can't live in circles again) (Break the chain, can't live in circles again) December (Break the chain, can't live in circles again) (Break the chain, can't live in circles again) December (Break the chain, can't live in circles again) (Break the chain)
Let me paint a picture for you then Iâll have to teach you to see it Illustrate the remnants of the life I used to live here in Eden Rolled a lucky pair of dice, Ended up paradiseâ¨ Landed on a snakeâs eyes, took a bite and ended up bleeding You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name The truth is all those angels started acting the sameâ¨ And I know thereâs no going back now 'cause Life in Eden Life in Eden changedâ¨ No way to make the pain play fairâ¨ It doesnât disappear just because you say it isnât there So when they ask whyâd she go you can say 'cause Life in Edenâ¨ Life in Eden changedâ¨ Life in Eden changed Walking in the garden was a serpent-shaped heart and he told meâ¨ What is broken cannot show, and less than beautiful is worse than unholy Idolized my innocence, Stole it from me in the endâ¨ Now Iâm wide awakened and still paying for the poison they sold me You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name The truth is all those angels started acting the sameâ¨ And I know thereâs no going back now 'causeâ¨ Life in Eden Life in Eden changedâ¨ No way to make the pain play fairâ¨ It doesnât disappear just because you say it isnât there, so When they ask whyâd she go you can say 'cause Life in Edenâ¨ Life in Eden changedâ¨ Life in Eden changed There was a time when I was taking all betsâ¨ that This place was even better than as good as it gets and now Looking back from the outside inâ¨ I think I was choking on the air in Eden Choking on the air in Eden Life in Eden changedâ¨ You know if I could change anything, I think I would start with the name The truth is all those angels started acting the sameâ¨ And I know thereâs no going back now 'causeâ¨ Life in Eden Life in Eden changedâ¨ No way to make the pain play fair It doesnât disappear just because you say it isnât there, so When they ask whyâd she go you can say 'cause Life in Eden Life in Eden changedâ¨ When they ask whyâd she go 'Cause life in Eden Life in Eden changed Life in Eden changed Life in Eden changed
Cinderella's on her bedroom floor she's got a Crush on the guy at the liquor store 'Cause Mr. Charming don't come home anymore and she forgets why she came here.  Sleeping Beauty's in a foul mood for shame she says None for you dear prince, I'm tired today. I'd rather sleep my whole life away than have you keep me from dreaming  I don't care for your fairytale You're so worried 'bout the maiden, Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing  Snow White is doing dishes again cause what else can you do With seven itty bitty men? Sends them to bed and she calls up a friend, says will you meet me at midnight.  The tall blonde lets out a cry of despair says Would have cut it myself if I knew men could climb hair I'll have to find another tower somewhere and keep away from the windows.  I don't care for your fairytale You're so worried 'bout the maiden, Though you know she's only waiting on the next best thing  Once upon a time in a faraway kingdom, man made up a story Said that I should believe him Go and tell your white knight that he's handsome in hindsight But I don't want the next best thing So I sing and hold my head down and I break these walls 'round me Can't take no more of your fairytale love I don't care for your fairytale You're so worried bout the maiden, Though you know she's used to waiting spent her whole life being graded on the Sanctity of patience and a dumb appreciation The story needs some mending and a better happy ending 'Cause I don't want the next best thing no no I don't want the next best thing.
Look how you're standing there There with your hands out Standing next to the road that goes up Running your mouth about how you're gonna wait for the one that comes down Who do you think you are? Somebody's baby? You want what everyone has but you want your name on it Think it happens like that? That would be nice wouldn't it I've gotta be careful of you I wanna get there too You wanna go, but you want a free ride You want it in but standing on the outside I'm not the one to call when it comes undone You want the world, but don't wanna pay out Don't wanna hurt, and don't wanna say out loud that I'm right There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride You say your turn is coming and that's what you told me So you stand in one place and wait for the tunnel to light up your face and award you for what you haven't done And I know it's out of my hands But I had to pay with blood, sweat, and tears while you dare to say that your lucky days passed you You wanna go, but you want a free ride You want it in, but standing on the outside I'm not the one to call when it comes undone You want the world, but don't wanna pay out Don't wanna hurt, and don't wanna say out loud that I'm right There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride I see you when the lights rise up You want some too How could anyone blame you I see you when the lights rise up You want some too How could anyone blame you You wanna go, but you wanna free ride You wanna go, but you wanna free ride You wanna go, but you wanna free ride You want it in, but standing on the outside I'm not the one to call when it comes undone You want the world, but don't wanna pay out Don't wanna hurt, and don't wanna say out loud that I'm right There's no end in sight waiting on a free ride Waiting on a free ride Waiting on a free ride Since you've been gone
Goodbye Should be sayin' that to you by now, shouldn't I? Layin' down the law that I live by Oh, maybe next time I've got a thick tongue Brimming with the words that go unsung I simmer, then I burn for someone The wrong one I tell myself to let the story end, oh My heart will rest in someone else's hand My why-not-me philosophy began And I say [Chorus] Oh, how am I gonna get over you? I'll be alright, just not tonight Someday, hey oh, I wish you'd want me to stay I'll be alright, just not tonight Someday "Maybe" it's a vicious little word that can slay me Keep me when I'm hurting and make me Hang from your hands Well, no more (no more) I won't beg to buy a shot at your back door If I make it at the thought of you, what for? (what for?) It's not me anymore And I'm not the girl that I intend to be I dare you, darling, just you wait and see But this time not for you but just for me And I say [Chorus] Say it's comin' soon, Someday without you All I can do, is get me past the ghost of you Wave goodbye to me I won't say I'm sorry I'll be alright, once I find the other side of Someday Oh, oh Whoa, oh Oh Oh, oh Whoa, oh Whoa, oh Whoa, oh [Chorus]
Something always brings me back to you. It never takes too long. No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'till the moment I'm gone. You hold me without touch. You keep me without chains. I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love And not feel your rain. Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity. Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be. But you're on to me and all over me. You loved me 'cause I'm fragile. When I thought that I was strong. But you touch me for a little while And all my fragile strength is gone. Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity. Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be. But you're on to me and all over me. I live here on my knees as I try to make you see That you're everything I think I need here on the ground. But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go. The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down, You're keeping me down Something always brings me back to you, It never takes too long
I miss the days my mind would just rest quiet My imagination hadnât turned on me yetâ¨ I used to let my words wax poeticâ¨ But it melted a puddle at my feet now It is a calcifying crime, itâs tragic Iâve turned to petrified past life baggage I want to disappear and just start over So here we are And Iâll breathe again 'Cause I have sent for a warriorâ¨ From on my knees, make me a Hercules I was meant to be a warrior please Make me a Hercules Iâve lost a grip on where I started fromâ¨ I wish Iâd thought ahead and left a few crumbs Iâm on the hunt for who Iâve not yet become But Iâd settle for little equilibriumâ¨ There is a war inside my heart gone silent Both sides dissatisfied and somewhat violent The issue I have now begun to seeâ¨ I am the only lonely casualty This is not the end though 'Cause I have sent for a warriorâ¨ From on my knees, make me a Hercules I was meant to be a warrior please Make me a Herculesâ¨ 'Cause I have sent for a warriorâ¨ From on my knees, make me a Hercules I was meant to be a warrior please Make me a Hercules This is my darkest hourâ¨ A long road has lead me out hereâ¨ But I only need turn around to face the light And decide flight or fight 'Cause I have sent for a warriorâ¨ From on my knees, make me a Hercules I was meant to be a warrior please 'Cause I have sent for a warriorâ¨ From on my knees, make me a Hercules I was meant to be a warrior please Make me a Hercules
I never meant to be the one to let you down If anything, I thought I saw myself going first I didn't know how to stick around How to see anybody but me be getting hurt I keep remembering the summer night And the conversation breaking up the mood I didn't want to tell you you were right Like the season changing, oh, I felt it too [Chorus] Does anybody know how to hold my heart How to hold my heart? I don't want to let go, let go, let go too soon I want to tell you so before the sun goes dark How to hold my heart I don't want to let go, let go, let go of you I'm not the kind to try to tell you lies But the truth is you've been hiding from it too I see it sneaking in behind your eyes Saying things no words could ever do [Chorus] Is anybody listening? 'Cause I'm crying Is anybody listening? [Chorus]
Let the bough break, let it come down crashing Let the sun fade out to a dark sky I can't say I'd even notice it was absent 'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes I'll unfold before you Would have strung together The very first words of a lifelong love letter Tell the world that we finally got it all right I choose you I will become yours and you will become mine I choose you I choose You, yeah There was a time when I would have believed them If they told me that you could not come true Just love's illusion But then you found me And everything changed And I believe in something again My whole heart Will be yours forever This is a beautiful start To a lifelong love letter Tell the world that we finally got it all right I choose You I will become yours and you will become mine I choose You I choose You We are not perfect  we'll learn from our mistakes And as long as it takes  I will prove my love to you I am not scared of the elements  I am underprepared, But I am willing And even better I get to be the other half of you Tell the world that we finally got it all right I choose You, yeah I will become yours and you will become mine I choose You I choose   You I choose You

Love I get so lost, sometimes Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart When I want to run away I drive off in my car But, whichever way I go I come back to the place you are But, all my instincts - they return The grand facade so soon will burn Without a noise - without my pride I reach out from the inside Love love love love love I get so lost, sometimes Days pass they pass and this emptiness fills my heart When I want to run away I drive off in my car But, whichever way I go I come back to the place you are But, all my instincts - they return The grand facade so soon will burn Without a noise - without my pride I reach out from the inside In your eyes - the light, the heat I am complete in your eyes See the doorways of a thousand churches in your eyes The resolution of all the fruitless searching In Your Eyes Love love love love love I don't like to see so much pain So much wasted, and this moment keeps slipping away I get so tired working so hard for our survival I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive But, all my instincts - they return The grand facade so soon will burn Without a noise - without my pride I reach out from the inside In your eyes - the light, the heat I am complete in your eyes See the doorways of a thousand churches I will not be that complete In your eyes In your eyes In your eyes In your eyes Love I get so lost, sometimes
I've been winding down the same road for days, I've seen the coastline going both ways. Some days are perfect, and some simply could not get worse. Some days it's all worth it, and some days this life is nothing but a curse.  And I wonder who will break first  I am small. I feel like no more than nothing at all. But when I lose sight of daylight, and my darkness falls I'll be strong. And if not now it won't be long From when I lose sight of daylight And my hands are weak and my soul is tired Oh, I'll give my love from the inside out From the inside out  Little spirit, now don't you desert me now I know I don't always hear it, but you don't always speak so loud. And I'm not willing to simply lay down my soul for this. It may be all that I'm giving, oh but take my love for what it is.  I am small. I feel like no more than nothing at all. But when I lose sight of daylight, and my darkness falls I'll be strong. And if not now it won't be long From when I lose sight of daylight And my hands are weak and my soul is tired Oh, I'll give my love from the inside out From the inside out  Take your best shot. Here I stand heart in hand. And fearless I'm not, but I am what I am. I know what I'm not, and I know enough to know it's never Gonna be much more than weather, you can't drive me away When it's only rain. It's only rain. It's only rain. It's only rain.
(Ha ha haa) (Ha ha haa) (Ha ha haa) Waiting for the bus stop Waiting for the concrete black top to settle down Long enough for me to get off And get a little ground (Ha ha haa) Iâm ready for the sea change Helpless felt this coming from a mile away And now youâre looking at me babe, And how weâll separate if we can 'Cause I still count on one hand The number of good men I know Itâs like Iâm standing on the edge with just a telephone wire Trying to get to you first to say the worldâs on fire Holding my breath until I know youâre alright Because the water will only rise When will you realize (ha ha haa) You must become an island (Ha ha haa) you must become an island (Ha ha haa) you must become an island (Ha ha haa) and see for yourself Thatâs what I am (Ha ha haa) You always dirty up the windows If you keep âem at bay that way no oneâs gonna surprise you By getting too close Anybody but me though Youâve made exceptions to you rules And now weâre staring down truth Neither one of us wants to know Itâs like Iâm standing on the edge with just a telephone wire Trying to get to you first to say the worldâs on fire Holding my breath until I know youâre alright Because the water will only rise When will you realize (ha ha haa) You must become an island (Ha ha haa) you must become an island (Ha ha haa) you must become an island (Ha ha haa) and see for yourself the horizon is all we have See for yourself the horizon is all we have (Ha ha haa) (Ha ha haa) Holding my breath until I know youâre alright Because the water will only rise
All the colors Of the rainbow Hidden 'neath my skin Hearts have colors Don't we all know? Red runs through our veins Feel the fire burning up Inspire me with blood Of blue and green I have hope Inside is not a heart But a kaleidoscope
Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table While I look outside So many things I'd say if only I were able But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by You've got opinions, man We're all entitled to 'em, but I never asked So let me thank you for your time, And try not to waste anymore of mine And get out of here fast I hate to break it to you babe, but I'm not drowning There's no one here to save Who cares if you disagree? You are not me Who made you king of anything? So you dare tell me who to be? Who died and made you king of anything? You sound so innocent, all full of good intent Swear you know best But you expect me to jump up on board with you And ride off into your delusional sunset I'm not the one who's lost with no direction But you'll never see You're so busy making masks with my name on them in all caps You got the talking down, just not the listening And who cares if you disagree? You are not me Who made you king of anything? So you dare tell me who to be? Who died and made you king of anything? All my life I've tried to make everybody happy While I just hurt and hide Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide Who cares if you disagree? You are not me Who made you king of anything? So you dare tell me who to be? Who died and made you king of anything? Who cares if you disagree? You are not me Who made you king of anything? So you dare tell me who to be? Who died and made you king of anything? Let me hold your crown, babe
He was a good man he had a good heart with a good soul A good thing we had so I thought but I was wrong He let me down by never letting on He was as good as gone.

La da da da da da da CHORUS You talk about being lonely and tell me that your Sunsets weren't so great when you were waiting on me Oh but you don't know me I realize some other eyes were watching your sunrise You blame it on me and do it innocently don't leave Your hat on my door you don't live here no more The gig is up, game is through, And you lose. So Relax. And settle in To my story about one foolish King and his sin He had a Queen with a castle worth coming in Everyone said so but he's no good at listening It was one day and queenie's in a land far away And the good ol' King Restless is aching to play With the next best thing and the girl after that But it doesn't matter now, Cause I'm not coming back Not coming back. CHORUS You talk about being lonely and tell me that your Sunsets weren't so great when you were waiting on me Oh but you don't know me I realize some other eyes were watching your sunrise You blame it on me and do it innocently don't leave Your hat on my door you don't live here no more The gig is up, game is through, And you lose. You said I could stand next to you if I wanted to want the best for you But I don't so you make your next mistake on your own You can tell me to forgive you but don't ask twice Don't want to see the part of me that's made of fire And ice, talk of love talk of pain talk of fear all I hear is goodbye,. CHORUS You talk about being lonely and tell me that your Sunsets weren't so great when you were waiting on me Oh but you don't know me I realize some other eyes were watching your sunrise You blame it on me and do it innocently don't leave Your hat on my door you don't live here no more The gig is up, game is through, And you lose
I wish I were pretty I wish I were brave If I owned this city Then I'd make it behave And if I were fearless Then I'd speak my truth And the world would hear this That's what I wish I'd do, yeah If my hands could open, you'd see I'd take all these secrets in me And I'd move and mold them to be Something I'd set free I want to darken in the skies Open the floodgates up I want to change my mind I want to be enough I want the water in my eyes I want to cry until the end of time I want to let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down Let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down tonight I hold on to worry so tight It's safe in here right next to my heart Who now shouts at the top of her voice Let me go, let me out; this is not my choice And I always felt it before That the world was filled with much more Than the drowning soul I've learned to be I just need the rain to remind me I want to darken in the skies Open the floodgates up I want to change my mind I want to be enough I want the water in my eyes I want to cry until the end of time I want to let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down Let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down I want to let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down Let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down I want to let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down Let the rain come down Make a brand new ground Let the rain come down tonight
Tell the truth, no lies I can take it Burned your breath, just this once Run your mouth I bet I can catch it You sound just like a Judas And if there's anything I learned That would keep me standing If I take you and your word Then I'm empty handed A tongue like yours should be burned and branded So I can see you lie to me I wish the air would color red When you breath it in And so I could have seen it coming Look in my eyes when you say you love me So I can see you lie to me Lost be found I'm a bloodhound born for seeking Poor prey, you must be tired Stood your ground But your act drives a beating And now it's all on fire If there's anything I learned That would keep me standing If I take you at your word Then I'm empty handed A tongue like yours should be burned and branded So I can see you lie to me I wish the air would color red When you breath it in And so I could have seen it coming Look in my eyes when you say you love me So I can see you lie to me
Okay, I can see it now itâs all the same thing Just different wrapping around it No need, To soften your words Theyâre still gonna hurt So donât pull punches I tried,  to be everything youâd ever want  and sometimes I even stood on my heart and stomped now Iâm Finally alone and dressed for the show But going nowhere They donât need to see me crying Iâll get my little black dress on And if I put on my favorite song Iâm gonna dance until youâre all gone Iâll get my little black dress on You came Lifted me up but then you dropped a hurricane Now Iâm fighting to find the ground again, To steady my feet Get up off my knees and just remember that I am More than just somebodyâs puppet I can Find the cord and then Iâll cut it  I stand A pretty good chance to dust myself off and dance Iâll get my little black dress on And if I put on my favorite song Iâm gonna dance until youâre all gone Iâll get my little black dress on I got my little black dress on And if I tell myself that nothingâs wrong This doesnât have to be a sad song Not with my little black dress on Itâs time to connect the dots And draw a different picture up And paint you with the colors of Everything I ever was Return to the scene of the crime, The day I let the music die And rewrite the final lines 'cause this time I Iâll get my little black dress on And if I put on my favorite song Iâm gonna dance until youâre all gone Iâll get my little black dress on I got my little black dress on And if I tell myself that nothingâs wrong This doesnât have to be a sad song Not with my little black dress on
I donât care if the house is packed Or the strings of light are broken I donât care if the gifts are wrapped Or thereâs nothing here to open Love is not a toy, and no paper will conceal it Love is simply joy that Iâm home I donât care if the carpet's stained we've got food upon our table I donât care if itâs gonna rain, our little room is warm and stable Love is who we are, and no season can contain it Love would never fall for that We sing oo Oo Oo Let love lead us, love is Christmas Why so scared that youâll mess it up? When perfection keeps you haunted All we need is your best my love, thatâs all anyone ever wanted Love is how we do, let no judgment overrule it Love I look to you, and I sing Let love lead us, love is Christmas Let love lead us, love is Christmas
We met on a rainy evening in the summertime Don't think I need to tell you more I needed a raise I worked so hard for this love of mine Still I got nothing to show for it.  Tongue tied and twisted, go on baby and go to my head.  Here's a simplification of everything we're going though You plus me is bad news But you're a lovely creation and I like to think that I am too But my friend said I look better without you.  Too tired this time to deal with old suits you wear with your ties that won't bind.  Babe, baby believe me If I stay it ain't gonna be easy Okay we'll do it your way But this is the last time You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down Love on the rocks.  You love the chase but hate me for the runaround We both just tired of the whole thing. You tell me what you want you need you know you have to have And I just pretend I'm listening  Too tired this time to deal with old suits you wear with your ties that won't bind.  Babe, baby believe me If I stay it ain't gonna be easy Okay we'll do it your way But this is the last time You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down Love on the rocks.  Hot as hell cold as ice sip it slow cause it's so nice Dulls my senses drives my pain and still I do it again Burns a bit to the touch dangerous if it's too much If this bottle could talkÃ¢? ¦. Love on the Rocks  Babe, baby believe me If I stay it ain't gonna be easy Okay we'll do it your way But this is the last time You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down Love on the rocks.
Head underwater And they tell me To breathe easy for a while Breathing gets harder, even I know that Made room for me It's too soon to see If I'm happy in your hands I'm unusually hard to hold on to Blank stares at blank pages No easy way to say this You mean well, but you make this hard on me I'm not gonna write you a love song 'Cause you asked for it 'Cause you need one, you see I'm not gonna write you a love song 'Cause you tell me it's Make or breaking this If you're on your way I'm not gonna write you to stay If all you have is leavin' I'm a need a better reason To write you a love song Today, today, yeah I learned the hard way That they all say Things you want to hear My heavy heart sinks deep down under You and your twisted words Your help just hurts You are not what I thought you were Hello to high and dry Convince me to please you Make me think that I need this too I'm trying to let you hear me as I am I'm not gonna write you a love song 'Cause you asked for it 'Cause you need one, you see I'm not gonna write you alove song 'Cause you tell me it's Make or breaking this If you're on your way I'm not gonna write you to stay If all you have is leavin' I'ma need a better reason To write you a love song Today Promise me you'll leave the light on To help me see With daylight, my guide, gone 'Cause I believe there's a way You can love me because I say I'm not gonna write you a love song 'Cause you asked for it 'Cause you need one, You see I'm not gonna write you a love song 'Cause you tell me it's Make or breaking this Is that why you wanted a love song?

Tell me off in a letter Completely ignore me Gettin' high off of saying Why you don't adore me Baby, please, I'm well-versed In how I might be cursed I don't need it articulated Stand in line wasting All of your time, just to hate me Every dime gone to ways You can find that might bait me And drag me down, sight set proudly Bring me to the ground see You love to be somebody's enemy Maybe nobody loved you when you were young Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes Will you try it once? Give up the machine gun Machine gun, yeah Locked and loaded You're practically floating away now In your fortress you feel like You're more or less safe now But let me say, I don't mean harm Oh, but, baby, you'd be charming if you'd come undone Get back where you started from Maybe nobody loved you when you were young Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes Will you try it once? Give up the machine gun Machine gun Never mind how you've rationed your time And the battle is underway Maybe times are gonna change Don't just hide in the silence behind What you've really been trying to say What a skill, baby, aiming to kill me With words you don't mean Maybe nobody loved you when you were young Maybe, boy, when you cry, nobody ever comes Will you try it once?

You can have Manhattan I know it's for the best I'll gather up the avenues And leave them on your doorstep And I'll tip toe away So you won't have to say You heard me leave You can have Manhattan I know it's what you want The bustle and the buildings The weather in the fall And I'll bow out of place To save you some space For somebody new You can have Manhattan 'Cause I can't have you Ah You can have Manhattan The one we used to share The one where we were laughing And drunk on just being there Hang on to the reverie Could you do that for me 'Cause I'm just too sad to You can have Manhattan 'Cause I can't have you And so it goes One foot after the other 'Til black and white begin to color in And I know That holding us in place is simply fear Of what's already changed Ah You can have Manhattan I'll settle for the beach And sunsets facing westward with Sand beneath my feet I'll wish this away Just missing the days When I was one half of two You can have Manhattan 'Cause I can't have you
There's too many things that I haven't done yet Too many sunsets I haven't seen You can't waste the day wishing it'd slow down You would've thought by now I'd have learned something I made up my mind when I was a young girl I've been given this one world I won't worry it away But now and again I lose sight of the good life I get stuck in a low light But then Love comes in How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles Many the miles How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles But send me the miles and I'll be happy to follow you Love I do what I can wherever I end up To keep giving my good love And spreading it around Cause I've had my fair share of take care and goodbyes I've learned how to cry And I'm better for that Sing how far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles Many the miles How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles Send me the miles and I'll be happy to Follow you Love Red letter day and I'm in a blue mood Wishing that blue would just carry me away I've been talking to God don't know If it's helping or not But surely something has got to got to got to give Cause I can't keep waiting to live How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles Many the miles How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles But send me the miles and I'll be happy to yeah How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles Many the miles How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles Many the miles Been talking to God don't know if it's helping or not Many the miles Many the miles How far do I have to go to get to you Many the miles Many the miles Oh send me the miles and I'll be happy to Follow you Love There's too many things I haven't done yet Too many sunsets I haven't seen
I'm not scared of you now Or so I say There's no reason to run Although I may I'm not as sure as I seem This much I know What does it mean you leave and I follow I could try to forget what you do when I let you get Through to me but then you do it over again I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain I desire 'Till you get to me on my morningside Keep my distance I tried No use But no matter the miles I'm back to you I could try to forget what you do when I let you get Through to me but then you do it over again I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain I desire 'Till you get to me on my morningside Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder What it looks like here on my morningside Look back don't you dare let me start to do that I don't care if the things that I have Only make me afraid to lose I Need to let go Need to want to keep letting you know That we both have a reason to follow Long as we let this lead I'm barely breathing I try to forget what you do to me but then you do it over again I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain 'Till you get to me on my morningside Let me down you say never baby blues don't you ever I'm used to being one with the misfortune to find Afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder What it looks like here on my morningside
He bends his breath around my name And I am humbled I feel small and plain. But his arms are angels by his side. You need not ask if they're open, just how wide.  His lips are day, and his skin is night. Ooh, and with our love we conjure up the twilight. His fingers are music to my soul. And I feel his song play everywhere I go.  My love, my love is on his way Can't wait to see the day I thankfully lay me down My love my love is on his way I'm waiting patiently, but if you see me now My love, please hurry  He loves with rhythm, and paints with flame He comes in pieces with no name I won't need answers I'll just know Cause I've read the sonnets about his soul  He can be ordinary in the best ways And still dance like a poet through every word he says.  My love, my love is on his way Can't wait to see the day I thankfully lay me down My love my love is on his way I'm waiting patiently, but if you see me now My love, please hurry  All that I never knew can you see me now All that I never said, can you see me now  He makes me crazy, he makes me cruel. Oh, but I pray he makes me anything but a fool  Ooh, my love
It comes a calling in the evening When the temperature is dropping out They said it don't get cold here But I beg to differ now There is something in the shadows More than sister silhouette Something sinister and strange That I haven't seen yet And I don't wanna be alone Sky, don't let the sun go I'm not ready for the darkness Swear upon a heartless soul And I don't want to cry when you go Stay a little longer, you know You're making me feel I'm not alone You don't have to fight the bad guys Throwing punches out into the black If you have to tell me lies, I don't care Just give me some good back I don't want to be alone Sky, don't let the sun go I'm not ready for the darkness Swear upon a heartless soul And I don't want to cry when you go Stay a little longer, you know You're making me feel I'm not alone And if I only worry 'bout it Worry 'bout it, worry 'bout it I just keep breaking down Breaking down, breaking down Boy, I could do without Do without, do without A night of the bad dreams, sad things Tell me what that means I don't want to be alone Sky, don't let the sun go I'm not ready for the darkness Swear upon a heartless soul And I don't wanna cry when you go Stay a little longer, you know You're making me feel The monsters aren't real You're making me feel I'm not alone I'm not alone, no I'm not alone, no I'm not alone Oh, Whoa
Once upon another time Somebodyâs hands who felt like mine Turned the key and took a drive Was free  I recall the sun sank low Buckley on the radio Cigarette was burning slow So breathe  Just yellow lines and tire marks Sun-kissed skin and handle bars And where I stood was where I was To be  No enemies to call my own No porch light on to pull me home And where I was is beautiful Because I was free  Once upon another time Before I knew this life was mine Before I left the child behind Be I saw myself in summer nights And stars lit up like candle lights I made my wish but mostly I Believed  And yellow lines and tire marks Sun-kissed skin and handle bars And where I stood was where I was To be  Once upon another time Deciding nothing good in dying So I would just keep on driving Because I was free
Just about the time the shadows call I undress my mind and dare you to follow Paint a portrait of my mystery Only close my eyes and you are here with me A nameless face to think I see To sit and watch the waves with me till they're gone A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is Made out of my own devicesÃ¢? ¦ could I be wrong?  Time that I've taken Pray is not wasted Have I already tasted my piece of One sweet love? Ready and waiting For a heart worth the breaking But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of One sweet love.  Sleepless nights you creep inside of me Weave your shadows in the breath that we share You take more than just my sanity Take my reason not to care. No ordinary wings I'll need The sky itself will carry me back to you Things I dream that I can do I'll open up the moon for you Just come down soon  Time that I've taken Pray is not wasted Have I already tasted my piece of One sweet love? Ready and waiting For a heart worth the breaking But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of One sweet love.  Savor the sorrow to soften the pain Sip on the southern rain, as I do I don't look don't touch don't do anything But hope that there is a you.  The earth that is the space between I'd banish it from under meÃ¢? ¦to get to you. An unexpected love provides My solitary's suicideÃ¢? ¦ oh I wish I knew  Time that I've taken Pray is not wasted Have I already tasted my piece of One sweet love? Ready and waiting For a heart worth the breaking But I'd settle for an honest mistake in the name of One sweet love.
It's a feeling my hands and feet held to the floor Like I'm kneeling crawl straight to What fate sent through Holding down the only solid ground I could find cause I don't want to try the other kind  I don't have it yet a good sense of knowing when What I do should be immediate But all this waiting for a sign From the other side For fuck's sake this is just a timeline Just a timeline just a timeline Yeah Sara stop it pick out your paralysis and unlock it And flex the fear till it builds you a rocket And rise and if you fall At least you end up between where you will be And where you will have been Yeah I can't keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot Can't stay here no not anymore Can't stay here no not anymore Oh I just keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot Can't stay here no not anymore Can't stay here no not anymore Wooo oh oh Wooo oh oh Wish I was lying My worry circles my brain like it's dying And that redhead vulture is well fed But what that mutiny used to be is no use to me now Tell me how it all turns out cause I'm not sticking around I can't keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot Can't stay here no not anymore Can't stay here no not anymore Oh I just keep paying for the same spot in the parking lot Can't stay here no not anymore Can't stay here no not anymore Wooo oh oh Wooo oh oh Can't breathe in the parking lot Give me divine dissatisfaction Give me the heart unsettled soul Give me emotion into action Cause I can't take this anymore Can't breathe in the parking lot Wooo oh oh Wooo oh oh Not anymore Can't breathe in the parking lot Wooo oh oh Wooo oh oh
I've been down, I've been out. I did it all on my own. Seems growing up didn't take long. Feel Strange I feel good. I feel better with you. You've changed, you should. Cause I think I did too.  Made my mistakes, and did a few things right But it will take what it will take, baby that's life You cannot change what you do not own, everybody knows But if you live deep and love strong you get pretty damn close  It moves fast and it scares me. I close my eyes, oh but I still see  I'm fading in and out what are you supposed to do save me know From all of this danger you don't know how and I'll find my way out When I'm in the red listening to strangers inside my head The darkening angels beneath the bed I still see everything you said, Painted in Red  I shake and I smile, cause you said Baby girl it may take a while, but take the good from the bad And never minds are never sure so never leave them wanting more What are you waiting for? How you love is who you are.  I dive in and I sink in. And I find new colors to think inÃ¢? ¦  I'm fading in and out what are you supposed to do save me know From all of this danger you don't know how and I'll find my way out When I'm in the red listening to strangers inside my head The darkening angels beneath the bed I still see everything you said, Painted in Red  In the distance is a line defining where I've been the state I'm in And ever since it began to slip from my two hands I've been Taunting fires, touching wires, been believing liars, everything they said Painted in Red  I'm fading in and out what are you supposed to do save me know From all of this danger you don't know how and I'll find my way out When I'm in the red listening to strangers inside my head The darkening angels beneath the bed I still see everything you said, Painted in Red  What are you gonna do? No way for you to save me. What are you gonna do? Everything that you gave me is painted in Red.
Bound for the Blessing You wouldn't see it coming I keep you guessing Watch while you come undone.  You were an island that no one would dare to tread upon. I came in like the wise men, and ask you to take my gift of love.  Hold me responsible. It's all my fault. I want you to hold me any way you can. Hold me accountable. It's all my fault. I want you to hold me any way you can.  Careful confessions Can't scare you with my crime I learned my lesson Love you a little at a time.  But I'm losing my patience, getting acquainted with the edge. I'm ready and waiting. Happy to stand convicted.  Hold me responsible. It's all my fault. I want you to hold me any way you can. Hold me accountable. It's all my fault. I want you to hold me any way you can.  I can't change you when you won't change yourself. But I see you slowly becoming someone else. I can't blame you for the strength you lack. Scared to give what you may not get back.  Hold me responsible. It's all my fault. I want you to hold me any way you can. Hold me accountable. It's all my fault. I want you to hold me any way you can.
If I build it out of blood and bone If I love it and I even give it a good name And I let it stand up on it's own And if I even ever learn to trust and walk away Will it crumble on it's own two feet? Or will it multiply and grow big, white wings? If I love it and I give it life Can I let it go and know that it was never mine? Give more, Give it all away I'm sure it'll come back someday You gotta let go to let it circle back around To rise up you gotta learn to root down Learn to root down If I cut it with a heart-shaped knife And I send it to my very closest of friends And they somehow bring it back to life What if I only ever do it all over again? I'm a writer here upon this ship On a sea of unnamed and untamed passages And every vessel's meant for pouring out And every bloom has to make room to root down Give more, Give it all away I'm sure it'll come back someday You gotta let go to let it circle back around To rise up you gotta learn to root down Learn to root down Learn to root down Give more, Give it all away I'm sure it'll come back someday You gotta let go to let it circle back around To rise up you gotta learn to root down
This one's for the lonely child Broken hearted Running wild This was written for the one to blame For the one who believes they are the  cause of chaos in everything You may find yourself in the dead of night Lost somewhere out there in the great big beautiful sky We're all just perfect little satellites Spinning round and round this broken earthly life This is so you know the sound Of someone who loves you from the ground Tonight you're not alone at all This is me sending out my satellite call This is so you'll know the sound Of someone who loves you From the ground Tonight you're not alone at all This is me sending out my Satellite call
(Say you're sorry) won't you please (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) Circus of silence down at our feet Paper cut tigers starting to bleed Hang from your tightrope above the mess Just say you're sorry, no more, no less Words you won't use, you don't feel them like I do, I do (don't feel them like I do) Show will be over soon It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day I wanna walk away too But I want you to say you are sorry I'm not the one who went and made a mistake I wanna walk away too But I want you to say you are sorry (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) I used to believe that the storybook's true Now I don't need it at least not with you So if you see him, the man 'neath the mask Tell him I'm leaving and not looking back Words are no use (words are no use) You don't need them like (you don't need them like) I do Show will be over soon It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day I want to walk away too But I wanna to say you are sorry I'm not the one who went and made a mistake I wanna walk away too But I want you to say you are sorry I want the one word that you refuse to say to me You're so good at giving me responsibility I wash my hands clean and let you watch me as I go And I'm sorry for you, just so you know It's not the curtain closing causing us to call it a day I wanna walk away too But I want you to say you are sorry I'm not the one who went and made a mistake I wanna walk away too But I want you to say you are sorry (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry) (Say you're sorry)
Holding my breath Last one I've got left 'Til I see you Deliver my heart with the Pieces and parts of me left Every last day seemed to carry the weight a lifetime Watch from the ground As the gold fluttered down from the sky Sweet sun Send me the moon Empty the skies out Bringing me one step closer to you Send it soon And I will breathe in, breathe out 'Til you come in and out Of view Of view Inches away from you Scared what I'll take from you, darling I can live with your ghost If you say that's the most I'll get Darkness to light Move from day into night to be near you Still, here I stand I am sinking like sand in your sea Sweet sun Send me the moon Empty the skies out Bringing me one step closer to you Send it soon And I will breathe in, breathe out Until you come in and out Of view Of view Never you mind where the evening should find us Together, distance can't take what's hidden here Safe in my chest I'll wait for the day When we finally say now or never 'Til then I'll be here wanting more As I settle for atmosphere Sweet sun Send me the moon Empty the skies out Bringing me one step closer to you Send it soon And I will breathe in, breathe out 'Til you come in and out Of you Of you
[Verse 1] It's not simple to say Most days I don't recognize me With these shoes and this apron That place and it's patrons Have taken more than I've gave them It's not easy to know I'm not anything like I used be Although it's true I was never attention sweet center But I still remember that girl [Chorus] She's imperfect but she tries She is good but she lies She is hard on herself She is broken and won't ask for help She is messy but she's kind She is lonely, most of the time She is all of this, mixed up And baked in a beautiful pie She is gone, but she used to be mine [Verse 2] And it's not what I asked for Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor Carves out the person and makes you believe it's all true And now I've got you And you're not what I asked for If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back For a chance to start over And rewrite an ending or two For the girl that I knew [Verse 3] Would be reckless, just enough Who get hurt But who learns how to toughen up, when she's bruised And gets used by a man who can't love And then she'll get stuck and be scared Of the life that's inside her Growing stronger each day Til it finally reminds her To fight just a little To bring back the fire in her eyes That's been gone, but it used to be mine Used to be mine [Outro] She is messy, but she's kind She is lonely, most of the time She is all of this, mixed up, and baked in a beautiful pie She is gone, but she used to be mine
Sittin' in the mornin' sun I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come Watchin' the ships roll in And then I'll watch 'em roll away again I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay Watchin' the tide roll away Sit on the dock of the bay wastin' time, ooh ooh I left my home in Georgia Headed for the Frisco bay 'Cause I've got nothing to live for And nothing's gonna come my way I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay Watchin' the tide roll away Sit on the dock of the bay wastin' time Looks like nothing's gonna change, no no Everything still remains the same I can't do what ten people tell me to do So I guess I'm gonna stay the same, ooh Sittin' here restin' my bones This loneliness won't leave me alone Two thousand miles I roam Just to make this dock my home, yeah I'm gonna sit at the dock of the bay Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh I'm a sit on the dock of the bay wastin' time I'm gonna sit on the dock of the bay! Wastin' time, wastin' time, wastin' time
Ooh...  Since you went away, You can color me, colour me, colour me, colour me in grey So I'm working on the words I want to say I never knew, never knew, never knew your name You're just my soldier, babe You lost track of the days They come and they go, and they come and they go There's no way that I could keep up with it And I pray And I wonder, wonder, wonder if you hear me Ten thousand miles away Hey soldier I'm missing your life Wish I could hold ya And make it alright Sending you my love and a little light I never told ya That you're my soldier But goodnight You know it's gonna take, gonna take, gonna take more time Till we're staring up at the same sky And so I'm going to wait, going to wait, going to wait in line Till my soldier's mine Hey soldier I'm missing your life Wish I could hold ya And make it alright Sending you my love and a little light I never told ya That you're my soldier Goodnight I don't care how long it takes I'm not going anywhere, love (no) You see there This distance only makes me Say it over and over till it gets to you My soldier (ooh) Hey soldier I'm missing your life Wish I could hold ya And make it alright Sending you my love and a little light I never told ya You're my soldier Goodnight Sending you my love and a little light I never told ya That you're my soldier Goodnight (Goodnight) Goodnight (Goodnight) Goodnight, Goodnight Goodnight, Goodnight Mmm...
Saturday, empty room, filled with people It don't mean a thing to You and I, holding hands Nobody knows, nobody understands I don't care for sunlight That only means it's over And I'm in no mood for that Stay tonight Don't come morning, don't come light They may be lies, say it, say that we'll be alright If we stay tonight My hands are shaking This is a complicated love with me Keep your eyes closed, I've seen it baby I've seen where this goes Stay tonight Don't come morning, don't come light They may be lies, but say that we'll be alright If we stay tonight Gonna feel it baby Oh I don't wanna cry I know we'll get to tomorrow and say goodbye That's what I'm asking for Tonight Stay tonight Don't come morning, don't come light They may be lies but say that we'll be alright Say that we're gonna be alright Tonight
Sometimes I can be perfectly sweet Got this sugary me stuffed up in my sleeve And I talk of ponies and rainbows and things And I'm just who you want me to be But like most creatures down here on the ground I'm composed of the elements moving around And I grow and change and I shift and I switch And it turns out I'm actually kind of a b**** But that only happens when I get provoked By some piece of s*** a**hole we all sadly know And I sit and I write while reminding you all That mean songs are still better than going postal And that guy's an a**hole That girl's a b**** Baby it's natural No gettin' away from it So sing it out with me And then let it go F*** that guy he's just an a**hole Oh a**hole A**hole A**hole I see I've surprised you with some of my words And I know that surprises, while fun, still can hurt And I hate to think that I ruined the day Of the dick and the queen of the high horse parade But I'm sick and tired of your poisonous ways Your toxin wasting perfectly good space And I say what I think 'Cause it's more economic than drugs or a drink That guy's an a**hole That girl's a b**** Baby it's natural No gettin' away from it So sing it out with me And then let it go F*** that guy he's just an a**hole And I won't let him in Under my skin You're a sad sack of s*** That's pathetic Just a festering sore Who will never be more than that If I don't let it And that guy's an a**hole That girl's a b**** Baby it's natural No gettin' away from it So sing it out with me And then let it go F*** that guy he's just an a**hole That guy's an a**hole That girl's a b**** Baby it's natural No gettin' away from it So sing it out with me And then let it go F*** that guy he's just an a**hole
In the morning it comes, heaven sent a hurricane Not a trace of the sun, but I don't even run from rain Beating out of my chest, my heart is holding on to you From the moment I knew From the moment I knew You were the air in my breath filling up my love-soaked lungs Such a beautiful mess intertwined and overrun Nothing better than this, oh, and then the storm can come You feel just like the sun Just like the sun And if you say, be alright I'm gonna trust you, babe I'm gonna look in your eyes And if you say, be alright I'll follow you into the light Never mind what I knew, nothing seems to matter now Oh, who I was without you, I can do without No one knows where it ends, how it may came tumbling down But I'm here with you now I'm with you now And if you say be alright I'm gonna trust you, babe I'm gonna look in your eyes And if you say be alright I'll follow you into the light Let the world come rushing in Come down hard, come crashing All I need, is right here beside me I'm out of love, I swear it, Take my love and wear it Over your shoulders And if you say be alright I'm gonna trust you, babe I'm gonna look in your eyes And if you say be alright I'll follow you into the light The light The light
Pardon me, my mistake Thought it my turn for a break But since the rain loves my face I'll just let it be. Long since gave up on long walks To avoid the long talks Lately the silence won't stop Talking at me CHORUS And I'm getting weary waiting for the harbor lights to change I've forgotten what I do it for but I tread water just the same I tread water I tread water Even tried my fair share Thought the devil may care But I called him up, he's not there. What does that mean? CHORUS And I'm getting weary waiting for the harbor lights to change I've forgotten what I do it for but I tread water just the same I tread water I tread water Thought this life would lead Far from Beauty's Beast Well, I know at least You can't count me out Because I'm used to the water now. CHORUS And I'm getting weary waiting for the harbor lights to change I've forgotten what I do it for but I tread water just the same Never let this pair of hands forget to pull their weight This burden may be more than I would like to bear but Still it's less than I can take I tread water I tread water
From time to time I talk to you As if you could hear me speak. The breath of me but words of you You take the one away, and the other still makes me weak. Every now and then I start to laugh Thinking of the last time you kissed me free. Still reeling from the aftermath Of the savory storm of you and me It's a simple world I know the way it works. I know I'm not the first [CHORUS:] From time to time I turn to you But I won't let it show like you want me to. My head held so high; I can hardly see Wouldn't notice if you were turned to me. If you were turned to me. I hope you can understand Because we've all been there some When you're hanging from someone else's hand The moment of letting go will leave your fingertips numb. It's a simple world. I know the tables turn. And I'll close the book of you word after word. [CHORUS] If you were turned to me I wouldn't think twice to turn the tacit hands of time back to when you were mine. But it's a paradox of chains and locks I keep on looking forward when I walk so I see almost nothing at all... Except when from...  [CHORUS]
No words, my tears won't make any room for more And it don't hurt Like anything I've ever felt before This is no broken heart No familiar scars This territory goes uncharted Just me in a room sunk down in a house in a town And I don't breathe No, I never meant to let it get away from me No, too much to hold Everybody has to get their hands on gold And I want uncharted Stuck under the ceiling I made I can't help but feeling [Chorus] I'm going down Follow if you want I won't just hang around Like you'll show me where to go I'm already out A foolproof idea, so don't ask me how To get started, it's all uncharted Each day I'm countin' up the minutes 'Til I get alone, 'cause I can't stay In the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault, but I'm So alone, never knew how much I didn't know Oh, everything is uncharted I know I'm getting nowhere When I only sit and stare like [Chorus] Jump start my kaleidoscope heart Love to watch the colors fade They may not make sense But they sure as hell made me I won't go as a passenger, no Waiting for the road to be laid Though I may be going down I'm taking flame over burning out Compare Where you are to where you want to be And you'll get nowhere I'm going down Follow if you want to or just hang around Like you'll show me where to go I'm already out A foolproof idea, so don't ask me how To get started [Chorus]
Silly me, look what I did again. I found what I want is what I cannot have I didn't mean to be so predictable, But I blame it all on who made you irresistible  And it isn't something I need 'til you tell me I can't Why wear my heart on my sleeve when it looks so good in your hand.  My heart breaks in a heart beat And you storm me when you come and go The taste of something so sweet should have Warned me 'bout the undertow. Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go.  Little girl, I don't know why you stay. If I had a feather for every time daddy said that I could fly away. Old habits are so hard to break It'd be a shame to stop now that I've started to make really good mistakes.  And I don't know why I must ask for the forbidden fruit. I saw the snake in the grass, but I had bitten too soon.  My heart breaks in a heart beat And you storm me when you come and go The taste of something so sweet should have Warned me 'bout the undertow. Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go.  I should have seen you coming in Should recognize the signs a wave's gonna break Now, I've given in, why fight it when I'm resigned to simply live in your wake. Your wake  My heart breaks in a heart beat And you storm me when you come and go The taste of something so sweet should have Warned me 'bout the undertow. Oh, I couldn't find a better man to let me go.
